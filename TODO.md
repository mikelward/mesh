# TODO

The working front — concrete, checkable tasks for the current and next
milestone. The stable milestone arc is in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); update this
file as tasks land.

## M0 — It runs `ls` ✅ (done)

- [x] Cargo workspace, edition 2024, MSRV 1.85, `rust-toolchain.toml`
- [x] `crates/mesh` binary: `main` / `repl` / `lexer` / `builtins` / `exec`
- [x] Read/tokenize/dispatch loop over stdin (TTY + piped)
- [x] Launch external commands; exit-status conventions (127 / 126 / 128+sig)
- [x] Builtin: `exit` (8-bit masking); `cd` punted to M1 (tentative)
- [x] Unit tests (lexer) + end-to-end tests (built binary, std-only)
- [x] CI: fmt + clippy (`-D warnings`) + test on Linux and macOS

## M1 — A shell you'd actually sit in ✅ (done)

- [x] `reedline` line editor for interactive (TTY) input; std byte reader kept
      for piped input. Ctrl-D exits on an empty line; Ctrl-C cancels the line.
- [x] History (in-memory, reedline default). Persisted history: later.
- [x] Two-glyph prompt (`mesh$` / `mesh!`) via reedline.
- [x] Lexer v1 (**Model B**): `"…"` (escape+interpolate), `'…'` (escape, no
      interpolation), `r'…'`/`r"…"` (raw); unknown escape is an error; backslash
      escapes; concatenation; quoting suppresses tilde/glob expansion. Deferred:
      heredocs, `\`-newline continuation across lines.
- [x] Variables (simple): `name = value` / `name=value` assignment (session-
      global), `$name`/`${name}` + `$env.KEY` interpolation (in bare + `"…"`),
      unbound read is a loud error, no word-splitting of interpolated values.
      Deferred: list/map values (single-value assignment only), `:` modifiers,
      `export`, `global`/`unset`, function-local scope, `$sh.*`, `$env:get`.
- [x] Promote internals into `crates/mesh-core` (lib); binary becomes thin `main`
- [x] `;`, `&&`, `||` sequencing (bare only; short-circuit on the previous
      status; quoted/escaped operators literal). `&`/`|` deferred to job
      control/pipes.
- [x] `cd` builtin (basic): `$HOME` default, `cd -`, updates `$PWD`/`$OLDPWD`,
      rejects surplus operands. Still deferred: `CDPATH`, `--physical`, autocd,
      logical cwd.
- [x] `pwd` and `puts` builtins
- [x] Globs + `~` expansion (glob no-match → **empty**). `~user` and expansion
      suppression (quoting) still to come; non-UTF-8 lossy under String words.

## M2 — Pipes, redirection, and job control ✅ (done)

- [x] Pipelines (`a | b | c`) with pipefail status, ignoring an upstream
      `SIGPIPE` caused by a downstream stage closing the pipe.
- [x] Basic redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`) on external commands, including
      redirections on individual pipeline stages. Deferred: descriptor/stderr
      redirection, redirected builtins, and redirection without a command.
- [x] Fork-based executor and process groups (`fork`/`exec`, `setpgid`,
      `tcsetpgrp`) so mesh can own the terminal and manage foreground jobs.
- [x] Signal handling: terminal signals target the foreground process group;
      Ctrl-C interrupts it with status 130 while mesh survives, and idle
      Ctrl-Z/Ctrl-\\ do not suspend or terminate mesh. Stopped-job tracking and
      resumption land with the job table below.
- [x] Job table plus `jobs`, `fg`, and `bg` builtins for stopped foreground jobs.
      `N` and `%N` select a job; no operand selects the newest job. Background
      launch with bare `&` registers running commands and pipelines in the same
      table; background stdin defaults to `/dev/null`.
- [x] Hand the terminal to full-screen programs and restore the shell's terminal
      modes cleanly when they exit or stop.

## M3 — The mesh language (in progress)

- [x] First typed value: bracketed list literals in assignment
      (`xs = [a "b c"]`), including the distinct empty list (`xs = []`).
- [x] Explicit list spread into command arguments (`puts ...$xs`); using a list
      without `...` is a loud error rather than implicit word splitting.
- [x] Replace the incremental command lexer with the clean-break expression and
      block parser.
  - [x] Fix the parser grammar, precedence, attachment, and completeness contract
        in [`PARSER.md`](PARSER.md).
  - [x] Emit a span-carrying token stream without performing structural parsing.
  - [x] Parse tokens into command, expression, and block AST nodes.
  - [x] Route parser-owned expression errors through `parser::parse` at
        execution entry, including chained comparisons and arithmetic assignment
        syntax, while command words remain compatibility-owned until their AST
        adapter lands below.
  - [x] Add recursive AST execution for `Source`, `Statement`, `AndOr`,
        `Executable`, `Pipeline`, `Command`, and `Expr`; implement sequencing,
        `&&` / `||`, background execution, and control flow from those nodes.
  - [x] Adapt parser-native `Word` / `WordPiece` and redirects directly into the
        existing expansion and process layers without stringifying and reparsing
        the AST through the compatibility lexer.
  - [x] Evaluate expressions as typed values, including variables, member and
        index access, modifiers, lists and spread, unary and binary operators,
        and recursive `if` / `for` bodies; return explicit runtime errors for
        parsed expression forms that are not implemented yet.
  - [x] Store parsed function bodies as `parser::Source` and execute them
        recursively instead of retaining and reparsing raw body text.
  - [x] Remove the raw-text function, `if`, and `for` recognizers and their brace
        scanners; use only `ParseOutcome::Incomplete` to buffer compound input.
  - [x] Retire `lexer::split_line` and compatibility lexer types from the REPL
        execution path once commands and expressions run from the AST; retain
        the old lexer only where a temporary public compatibility surface or its
        tests still require it.
  - [x] Add regression coverage for parser-authoritative errors and completeness,
        stored function ASTs, nested compound bodies, quoting, interpolation,
        globbing, redirects, pipelines, guards, and background commands; verify
        that `repl.rs` has no raw compound recognizers or `lexer::split_line`.
- [x] General list expressions: nested values, indexing/slicing, `+=`, and
      expression-position spread.
  - [x] Exact integer indexing (`$xs[0]`, including negative indices) for the
        current list slice.
  - [x] Clamped range slicing (`...$xs[1..3]`, `...$xs[..=2]`) for the current
        list slice.
  - [x] Append assignment (`+=`) for strings and the current list slice.
  - [x] List-preserving assignment from a variable or slice (`ys = $xs`,
        `ys = $xs[1..]`).
  - [x] List-preserving append from a slice (`xs += $ys[1..]`).
  - [x] Nested values and one-level expression spread (`[$xs]` versus
        `[...$xs]`), including spreading an indexed nested list.
- [x] Ordered, string-keyed maps: literals (including `[:]`), duplicate-key
      replacement, map spread, strict dot/bracket access, `+=` merge, and
      `:keys` / `:values` / `:len` collection modifiers.
- [ ] Remaining scalar types.
- [x] Initial argument-free `:` modifiers: path/string transforms and list
      collection operations, including typed list results and chaining.
- [x] `func` — user-defined functions: `func name(params) { body }` with required
      named positionals, multi-line bodies, function-local (lexical) scope, and
      `return`. Resolution is builtins → functions → external. Deferred:
      flags/optionals/rest parameters, functions in pipelines/redirections, and
      calling for a value (`f(arg)`) vs running (`f arg`).
- [x] First `if` expression slice — command-status conditions, brace-delimited
      `else` / `else if`, multiline bodies, and assignment-position string/list
      results. Deferred with the general expression parser: boolean/comparison
      conditions and conditional destructuring.
- [ ] `for` / `match`.
  - [x] First `for` slice over string lists and expanded word expressions, with
        brace-delimited multiline bodies and current-scope bindings.
  - [ ] Map/range iteration, destructured binders, `break`, and `continue`.

## Decisions made

- **Merge method:** rebase. **Toolchain:** floating `stable`. **Loop autonomy:**
  proceed with best call, documented + overridable; pause only for grammar-level
  design decisions.
- **Working-directory var namespace = `$env.PWD` / `$env.OLDPWD`** (confirms
  `DESIGN.md`; the `$sh.*` alternative was considered and dropped — if a value is
  exported to and inherited by children, it lives under `$env.`).
- **Heredocs interpolate by default; a quoted delimiter is raw.** `<< END … END`
  interpolates (`$var` + the `"…"` escape set); `<< 'END' … END` is raw — no
  interpolation, no escapes — the bash convention. The **quoted-delimiter** heredoc
  is the raw mixed-quote string form (embeds both `'` and `"` with no escaping),
  chosen over a Rust-style `r#"…"#` delimiter. Its value-producing spelling (vs
  command-redirection) is still open below. Implementation lands with the quoting
  task (task 5).
- **Repo license = decide later** (leave unlicensed for now; revisit before any
  real release). Recorded in "Decisions needed" below for visibility.
- **Glob no-match → empty** (nullglob-style: the pattern expands to zero words).
  This is *principled*, not a compromise, and fully consistent with "absence is
  loud": specific-element access (`xs[99]`, `$map.key`) errors because you asked
  for one thing that isn't there and there is no null; a glob (`*.txt`) is a
  **collection query** whose result type is a *list*, so zero matches = the empty
  list = a complete, honest answer, not an absence. Rejects bash's literal
  pass-through as a footgun.

## Decisions needed

- [ ] **Regex literal + absolute-path rule** *(direction chosen — see the block in
      [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) "Quoting and escaping")*. **Keep `/…/`** as the regex
      literal; in a match slot a leading-slash word is a regex only when it is a clean
      `/BODY/` (closing `/` final, no unescaped interior `/`), otherwise it is a
      path/glob — so absolute globs/paths go bare, no `glob("…")` wrapper. Known
      **residual** (accepted): a single segment with a trailing slash (`$p ~ /tmp/`)
      reads as the regex `tmp`; workaround is `$p ~ /tmp`, or `glob(…)`/`==`. Set
      aside (documented as alternatives in DESIGN.md): the `rx'…'` **regex-literal**
      sugar and RHS string→regex coercion. The `r'…'` / `r"…"` **raw strings** are
      *adopted* (Model B, below), not set aside. Still open under this direction:
  - [x] **String→regex coercion on the RHS — decided: no coercion (for now).** A
        plain string / `$var` on the `~`/`match` RHS stays an **error**; a regex must
        be explicit (`/…/` or `re($pat)`). Keeps the no-silent-coercion rule and
        avoids the "quotes mean literal" inversion. Revisitable.
  - [x] **String model — decided: Model B.** `"…"` interpolates + escapes; `'…'` is
        non-interpolating but **escaped** (Python `str`: `\n \t \r \e \\ \'` + `\u{…}`,
        `$` literal, unknown escape is an error); `r'…'` / `r"…"` are **raw** (regex
        source, paths). This retires the original "keep `'…'`'s two escapes or go
        fully raw" question — `'…'` is no longer raw; rawness moved to `r'…'`.
  - [x] **Regex-flag modifiers — decided: coexist.** Regex values take `:` modifiers
        (`re($x):i`, `$re:m`, `:s`) **and** the `--ignore-case` constructor flag
        stays — both spellings supported. A **parse-affecting** flag is *not* a
        post-hoc modifier (`re()` is fail-loud and compiles the unflagged pattern
        first): use `re($x --extended)` for a dynamic pattern, and reserve trailing
        `:x` for a `/…/` literal that folds it in before compilation (`/…/:x`).
        `--literal` stays a constructor argument.
  - [ ] **Value-producing raw heredoc** — the decided both-quote-kinds raw form is a
        heredoc, but the only heredoc specified today is command-redirection (feeds
        bytes to a command; an unquoted delimiter would expand). A raw,
        *value-producing* heredoc spelling still needs defining.
- [ ] **Choose a repo license** — *decided: later* (revisit before any real
      release). Nothing constrains the choice today: all current/planned deps are
      permissive (`reedline`/`nix`/`crossterm` MIT) except `nucleo` **MPL-2.0**
      (weak, file-level copyleft — compatible with a permissive project). Likely
      landing spot: `MIT OR Apache-2.0` (the Rust-ecosystem norm).

## Icebox / decide later

- [x] **`return` with no argument — use the last status.** `exit` already does
      this (a bare `exit` leaves the last command's status). Apply the same rule
      to `return` when it lands with function bodies.
- [ ] **Reserve only bare `_` as discard, allow `_name`.** Today a name must
      start with a letter, so a leading underscore is rejected wholesale (`_` and
      `_x` alike) — `_` is the discard pattern (`DESIGN.md`). Reconsider narrowing
      the reservation to **bare `_` only**, letting `_name` (underscore + letters)
      be a valid identifier, the common "intentional / private / unused-but-named"
      convention. Would touch `read_name` (allow a `_` head as long as the whole
      token isn't just `_`) and the `GRAMMAR.md` name rule.
- [ ] **Optional commas + word×list distribution in list literals.** Two related
      list ergonomics, motivated by the bash `mv foo{,bak}` idiom (rename
      `foo` → `foobak` in one word):
  - **Optional commas** — accept `[a, b, c]` as well as `[a b c]`. Decide whether
    *empty* elements are allowed (`[, bak]` → an empty-string first element),
    which is what would make `foo[, bak]` a terse cross-product.
  - **Word × list distribution** — `pre[a b]` → `prea preb` (distribute a prefix
    over a list), the list-native analog of brace expansion, so `mv foo['' bak]`
    or `mv foo[, bak]` → `mv foo foobak`. Blocked on a disambiguation rule versus
    the **glob character class** `[abc]` (already implemented): `foo[a b]` differs
    from the class `foo[ab]` only by a space.
      Note: bash-style **braces are already kept** (`DESIGN.md` "Braces — kept";
      `mv foo{,bak}` is the specced idiom), so this is about whether the list
      syntax should *also* cover it, not a missing capability. Leaning (from
      discussion): keep `{,}` for textual expansion, keep `[]` for real list
      values, maybe add optional commas — but don't overload `foo[…]` for
      brace-style expansion (small payoff, muddies the glob-class / list / index
      story).
- [ ] **Empty-glob warning (optional).** Keep behavior "empty always", but
      consider *warning* on an empty glob expansion while still proceeding — mesh
      is the only party that can detect it (the argv boundary carries bytes, not
      lists, so the emptiness is erased at `execve`; a downstream `grep` can't
      tell `grep foo *.log`-matched-nothing from `grep foo`). Interactively it
      could even prompt what to do. Warn on an empty *glob*, not on a genuinely
      empty `$list`.
- [ ] Reading a script file as an argument (`mesh script.msh`) vs. stdin only
- [ ] Allow list values to flatten automatically at the external-command
      boundary, so callers do not have to write the explicit `...` operator.
- [ ] `-c "…"` one-shot command flag
- [ ] Whether satellite helpers (`vcs`, prompt) are Rust workspace members or
      standalone (per-helper call; see `DEVELOPMENT.md`)
