# Design

## What this is

A personal, **interactive-first** Unix shell. The goal is a shell that is a
pleasure to *use* at a terminal all day — not a general-purpose scripting
language, and not a POSIX-compatible `sh`. Where nontrivial logic is needed
(prompt rendering, VCS info), the shell leans on small external binaries (the
`vcs`-style split) rather than growing a heavy scripting layer.

The emphasis is interactive use, but fixing the two things that make today's
interactive shells worse than they need to be:

- **Safer word expansion.** A bare `$x` never word-splits on whitespace or
  silently glob-expands. The default capture splits on newlines and lists stay
  whole (see [Command substitution](#command-substitution) /
  [Spread](#spread--flattening)) — the footgun is opt-*in*, spelled `...`, not
  opt-out via quoting.
- **No backwards-compatibility contortions.** bash arrays are the cautionary
  tale: a genuinely useful feature bolted onto a word-splitting, POSIX-compatible
  base until it takes `"${arr[@]}"` incantations to use without getting burned.
  mesh starts from a clean base instead, so arrays, maps, expansion, and quoting
  are *boring and safe by default* — the point of the [clean
  break](#core-decisions).

### Goals

The overriding goal is **ergonomics** — interactive use comes first (the *e* in
mesh is for *ergonomic*). In service of that, syntax aims to be **familiar,
consistent, and concise** at once: reuse what people already know, make it
compose the same way everywhere, and keep it short. These are *facets* of good
ergonomics, not a ranked checklist — when they pull apart, the tie-breaker is
whichever is better **to use interactively**, decided case by case, not a fixed
precedence among the three.

- Excellent interactive ergonomics: completion, history, line editing, prompt.
- **Byte-stream pipes** — external commands and coreutils work exactly as they
  do everywhere else. No structured-data pipeline (that is the one thing that
  rules out a nushell-style model here).
- **Real arrays / lists** with **no word-splitting footguns**.
- A **clean-break syntax**: keep the muscle memory that is worth keeping, fix
  the parts that are genuinely bad, and do not carry POSIX warts forward.
- First-class prompt hooks, session management, and job control.
- **Correctness and a simple, clear implementation over micro-performance.** When
  a choice is between an obviously-correct, easy-to-read implementation and a
  faster but subtler one, take the former; a shell's interactive latency is
  dominated by the programs it launches and by I/O, not by shaving cycles off the
  language runtime. Small performance differences never justify a design that is
  harder to reason about or a behavior that is harder to specify. (Genuine
  interactive responsiveness — startup time, prompt render, completion latency —
  still matters and is an ergonomics concern; this goal is about not trading
  clarity for *marginal* speed.)

### Non-goals

- Being a scripting language. Interactive use comes first; big logic goes into
  binaries.
- Running existing `sh`/`bash` scripts verbatim. External *programs* run
  normally; the shell *language* is new.
- A structured-data pipeline. Pipes carry bytes.

## Core decisions

| Area | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Implementation language | **Rust** (best line-editor / TUI ecosystem — reedline, nucleo, crossterm; strong POSIX job-control via `nix`). Satellite helpers (prompt, VCS) may be any language, e.g. Go. |
| Pipe model | **Byte streams.** Coreutils and external programs are first-class. |
| Values | **Real arrays / lists.** No implicit word splitting, ever. |
| Syntax | **Clean break** from POSIX. |
| Config / logic | Written in the shell's own language, with an escape hatch to external binaries for anything heavy or perf-sensitive. |

### Why Rust

The two subsystems that make or break an interactive shell both favor Rust
decisively:

- **Line editing / completion** — `reedline` (multiline, vi+emacs keymaps,
  hinting, history backends), `nucleo` (fzf-grade fuzzy matching, as used by
  Helix), `crossterm`. This is almost exactly the interactive feature set we
  want, already built.
- **Job control** — `nix` exposes the full POSIX surface (`setpgid`,
  `tcsetpgrp`, `WUNTRACED`, signalfd) needed for real `Ctrl-Z` / `fg` / `bg`
  and handing the terminal to a full-screen program like `vim`. This is the
  headline feature ("run vim and a shell/tail in the same shell"), and it is
  the area where Go actively fights the runtime.

Go's genuine wins (goroutines, effortless static builds) land on the *satellite*
work, which stays available: helper binaries can be written in anything.

## Requirements carried over from existing configs

These are treated as settled requirements, drawn from the author's current
bash/zsh/fish/nushell setup:

- **Prompt as a status dashboard** — two-line, full-width, showing host,
  session, VCS/dir, auth, jobs, last-exit status, and timing; a **transient**
  old prompt that collapses in scrollback. The prompt glyph signals which
  shell/mode you are in.
- **Composable prompt hooks** — the prompt may be rendered by an external
  binary, *provided* override hooks (e.g. the `ssh-add` "no identity" warning,
  a `[root]` tag, the session nag) can layer on top. Hooks compose; they do not
  replace each other.
- **Session management** baked in — attach-or-create on login, per-project
  sessions, job publishing to the status bar. shpool preferred, tmux fallback.
- **Emacs keys layered over vi mode** — both keymaps active; two grades of word
  motion; Esc/Alt disambiguation.
- **Fuzzy + case-insensitive completion.**
- **Job control** — the headline feature.
- **Idempotent, guarded PATH** — a single source of truth, deduped, applied
  once per process tree.
- **A predicate vocabulary** — `have_command`, `inside_project`,
  `connected_remotely`, and friends.

## Language sketch

Everything below is **decided** unless marked *(open)*.

### Command substitution

A command substitution **captures the command's raw output bytes.** What you get
back depends on the split that is applied to that capture:

```
$(cmd)          # default: split raw bytes on newlines, trim trailing blank -> list
"$(cmd)"        # one string (trailing newline trimmed)
$(cmd):nulls    # split the raw bytes on NUL -> list  (newline-safe)
$(cmd):raw      # the raw bytes, unsplit, trailing newline intact
```

Newline-splitting is the **default** because it is the dominant Unix convention
(`ls`, `find`, `grep`, `ps`) and never breaks on spaces in filenames — the
classic word-splitting footgun. But it is only the default: a split modifier
**replaces** it and runs against the raw capture (see [Modifiers](#modifiers)),
so the default split never destroys bytes that an explicit splitter needs. In
particular, splitting is applied *once*, not layered on top of the newline
split — `:nulls` sees the raw output (so `find -print0` filenames containing
newlines survive), and `:raw` keeps the trailing newline the default would trim.

### Modifiers

A **postfix modifier** transforms a value. The operator is `:`, followed by a
readable keyword. This is the zsh history-modifier idea (`:h :t :r :e`) but with
*words instead of cryptic letters*.

There are four kinds of modifier, and the difference matters:

- **Split modifiers** (`:lines :words :nulls :tabs :split`) turn a command
  substitution's **raw byte capture** into a list. They *replace* the default
  newline split and run against the raw bytes — they never run *after* it. Each
  applies to a `$(…)` capture, producing the list. They apply equally to a
  **plain string value** (`$line:split(":")`, `gets():words`) — there the string's
  own bytes are the input and there is no default split to override; the `$(…)`
  capture is just the most common source. The odd one out is **`:raw`**,
  which lives in the same capture-modifier family but is the *no-split* member:
  it yields the raw bytes as **one string**, not a list (it is what turns the
  default newline-splitting off). So every split modifier produces a list
  *except* `:raw`, whose whole job is to hand back a single byte-string.
- **Value modifiers** (path and string — `:stem`, `:dir`, `:stripend`, …) transform
  a value, and **map over a list** automatically (applied to each element).
- **Collection modifiers** (`:len :first :last :rest :init :keys :values
  :has :get :join :dedup`) consume a list or map **as a whole** — they do *not* map element-wise
  — and return either a scalar (`:len` → int, `:join` → one byte-string) or a
  derived collection (`:rest`, `:keys`, `:dedup`). This is the category that answers "how
  long," "the last one," and "flatten to a string." `:join(SEP)` is the fold
  that turns a list back into bytes (`$dirs:join(":")`); it stringifies each
  element and errors on a nested list or map (there is no implicit deep
  flattening — spell it out). **`:dedup`** returns the list with duplicate
  elements removed — **keep-first, order-preserving**, equality by value — so
  `$env.PATH:dedup` is the guarded, deduped PATH; unlike Unix `uniq(1)` it drops
  *non-adjacent* duplicates and needs no prior sort. It is **pure** (returns a new
  list — `$env.PATH = $env.PATH:dedup` to store) and lists-only. The full list/map
  surface is in [Arrays](#arrays-lists) and [Maps](#maps-associative-arrays).
- **Filter modifiers** (`:files`/`:f`, `:dirs`/`:d`, `:links`/`:l`,
  `:exec`/`:x`) keep the list elements matching a **file-type predicate** and
  drop the rest — a subset, not a transform. They **chain for AND** (`:f:x` =
  executable files) and are the `:` spelling of the glob type qualifiers
  (`*:f` ≡ `*(f)`, see [Globbing](#globbing)); on a glob the engine fuses the
  filter into matching, but they work on any path list too (`$paths:files`).

All four kinds:

- **chain**: `$f:stem:stem`, `$(cmd):nulls` then value modifiers over each item,
  `$xs:rest:last` (collection modifiers compose too).
- **No-argument modifiers are bare; arguments are parenthesized.** A modifier that
  takes **no** argument is written bare and chains by adjacency — `$f:stem:dir`,
  `$xs:rest:last`, `:dedup`, `:values` — never `:first()`. A modifier that **takes
  arguments** uses **parentheses**, comma-separated inside like a
  [value call](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas): `:split(":")`, `:get(EDITOR, vim)`,
  `:get(99, "-")`, `:match(/re/)`. One form, no exceptions — a **regex** argument is
  just a `/…/` literal sitting inside the parens like any other value — so there is
  no load-bearing whitespace to trip over and chaining is always unambiguous:
  `$host:split("."):first` reads exactly one way.
- **Disambiguation:** `:` is a modifier only when immediately followed by a
  known modifier keyword. `$host:$port` keeps `:` literal (the token after `:`
  is an expansion, not a keyword), so building `host:port`-style strings — or
  any `a:b` construction — is unaffected.

**Split modifiers** (choose the separator). These bind to a substitution's raw
byte capture and replace the default newline split:

```
$(cmd):lines        # split raw bytes on newlines (explicit form of the default)
$(cmd):words        # split on whitespace runs (opt-in; the old IFS behavior)
$(cmd):nulls        # split on NUL   (find -print0 / xargs -0; newline-safe)
$(cmd):tabs         # split on tab   (TSV)
$(cmd):raw          # no split; raw bytes including the trailing newline
$(cmd):split(":")    # split on an arbitrary separator
```

The delimiter is a **terminator, not a separator**: **trailing empty fields are
dropped** — any run of delimiters at the very end contributes nothing. So
`find -print0` (which ends every path, including the last, with NUL) yields
exactly the paths — `a\0b\0` → `[a b]` — and a stray blank line at the end of
output never becomes a phantom element. This generalizes the default newline
split's trailing trim. **Interior** empty fields are *kept* (`a\0\0b\0` →
`[a "" b]`), so structure in the middle survives; an **empty capture** — or one
that is nothing but delimiters — is the empty list `[]`. `:words` is the
exception that ignores whitespace entirely — leading, trailing, and runs — so it
never yields empty elements (the classic IFS word-split). `:raw` does not split
at all (it is the [no-split capture member](#modifiers), one byte-string).

**Path components** — for `a/b/foo.tar.gz`:

| Modifier | Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:dir` | `a/b` | dirname |
| `:base` | `foo.tar.gz` | basename |
| `:ext` | `gz` | last extension (no leading dot) |
| `:exts` | `tar.gz` | **all** extensions (no leading dot) |
| `:stem` | `foo.tar` | basename minus the **last** extension |
| `:bare` | `foo` | basename minus **all** extensions |
| `:real` | *(absolute)* | resolved real path |

Rules:

- `:ext` **excludes the dot** (`txt`, not `.txt`) — better for comparisons
  (`if $f:ext == md`). Rebuild with `($f:stem).png`.
- A **leading** dot is not an extension: `.bashrc:ext` is empty, and `.bashrc:base`,
  `.bashrc:stem`, and `.bashrc:bare` are all `.bashrc` (dotfiles stay whole).
- `:base` splits into `:bare` + `:exts` (first dot); `:base` also splits into
  `:stem` + `:ext` (last dot) — `foo.tar.gz` is `foo`+`tar.gz` or `foo.tar`+`gz`.
- `:bare` strips *every* dot-suffix, so on a dotted non-extension name like
  `2024.01.report` it yields `2024`. `:stem` (last only) is the safe default;
  reach for `:bare` when you mean "strip it all." Controlled peeling is also
  available via chaining (`$f:stem:stem`). `:bare` is one letter from `:base`
  (basename, extensions **kept**) — the mnemonic is *bare* = stripped down.

*(TODO — decisions surfaced porting real `PATH` / `find_up` code:*
- ***Transform-vs-predicate overlap.*** Keeping directories is the settled
  `:dirs` / `:d` filter modifier; the open question is only the footgun sitting
  next to it — `:dir` is *dirname* (a transform), so `$paths:filter(:dir)` silently
  keeps **everything** (a dirname is always a truthy string) when `$paths:dirs` (the
  directory **filter** modifier) was meant. Decide whether a transform modifier
  surfacing as a predicate's truthy value should be a **loud error** rather than a
  quiet keep-all.
- ***Upward path walk — `:ancestors` / `:parents`.*** `find_up`, project-root
  detection, and `rootdir` all want `pwd():ancestors` → `[/a/b/c /a/b /a /]`, turning
  a `cd ..`-in-a-subshell loop into a plain list iteration — `pwd()`, the *validated*
  shell-owned cwd, not the possibly-stale `$env.PWD`. Decide the name and whether it
  includes the path itself and the `/` root.)*

This modifier system is the direct answer to
[fish #4002](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4002) ("a
dead-simple way to strip a suffix"): it is a first-class language feature, not a
custom function.

**String** *(open — initial set)*: `:replaceall(OLD, NEW)` and its anchored/removal
kin (`:replacestart` / `:replaceend` / `:stripstart` / `:stripend`, plus
`:trimstart` / `:trimend` for whitespace), and likely `:upper` / `:lower`. To be
fleshed out.

**Anchored and removal variants** *(decided; lower priority to implement)*. Alongside
the global `:replaceall`, a start/end-anchored
`:replacestart(OLD, NEW)` / `:replaceend(OLD, NEW)` act only on a **leading** /
**trailing** match — their `OLD` is a match slot exactly like `:replaceall`'s (a
string is literal, a `/…/` is a regex, so `$s:replaceend(/\.js$/, ".ts")` works).
`:stripstart(PREFIX)` / `:stripend(SUFFIX)` are the removal
shorthand (`:stripend(x)` == `:replaceend(x, "")`): each drops the affix **once if the
string starts / ends with it**, and is a no-op otherwise — `"report.tar.gz":stripend(".tar.gz")`
is `report`. This is the everyday "drop a known suffix" reach — the spirit of bash's
`basename "$f" .tar.gz`, though a pure string op, not its equal (it doesn't strip the
dirname, and has none of basename's POSIX corner cases) — with no regex escaping and no
interior-match surprise (a global `:replaceall(".tar.gz", "")` would also rewrite
`a.tar.gz.bak`). Separately,
`:trimstart` / `:trimend` peel **whitespace** (or a given **char set**) repeatedly —
the trailing-newline case, not a known suffix.

**Regex substitution is `:replaceall` with a regex `OLD`** *(decided — the "sed
`s///` in a modifier" case)*. There is **no `:s/old/new/` form**. It would fight
three settled decisions at once: **`:s` is already taken** — it is the terse
spelling of the `:dotall` regex flag (see [`re()`](#tests-and-comparisons)), so `$f:s/…/…/` is
ambiguous with a flagged value; **arguments are parenthesized, with no exceptions**
(a regex argument is a `/…/` literal *inside* the parens like any other value — see
[Modifiers](#modifiers)), so a slash-delimited inline argument is the one shape the
grammar deliberately doesn't have; and mesh **already declined sed's `s///`** for
[history substitution](#history-expansion) in favor of the `old=new` mapping form.
Reintroducing `s///` here would make it the sole place slashes delimit a modifier
argument.

Instead, the everyday substitution the user reaches for is the **existing
`:replaceall(OLD, NEW)`** with a **regex** `OLD`:

```
$f:replaceall("foo", "bar")     # literal substring replace
$f:replaceall(/foo/, bar)       # regex replace  — the :s/foo/bar case
$f:replaceall(/foo/:i, bar)     # flags ride on the regex value (case-insensitive)
$line:replaceall(re($pat), $new) # pattern arrives as a string → re()
```

- **The argument type decides**, no second operator: a **string** `OLD` matches
  **verbatim** (metacharacters are literal), a **regex** `OLD` (`/…/` or an `re()`
  value) matches as a pattern. This is the same no-silent-coercion rule as `~` and
  `:int` — a string full of `.`/`*` never quietly becomes a pattern. The **first
  (`OLD`) argument of the replace family** — `:replaceall` and its anchored
  `:replacestart` / `:replaceend` kin — is a [regex match slot](#tests-and-comparisons),
  the fourth, alongside the `~`/`!~` RHS, the `:match` argument, and a `match` arm — so
  a bare `/foo/` there is a regex, not a path. (`NEW` is an ordinary value slot; a
  `/…/` there is a literal string.)
- **Global by default** — the name says so: every occurrence, matching the [history `old=new`](#history-expansion)
  precedent (mesh has no per-line notion here for a `/g` toggle to hang off).
- It is a **value modifier**, so it **maps over a list** element-wise like `:stem`
  — `$paths:replaceall(/\.js$/, .ts)` rewrites each path.
- **Capture backreferences** in `NEW` for a regex `OLD` *(provisional spelling)*:
  `${1}` / `${name}` currently stand in for syntax that splices
  the numbered / named group of *this match* (a replacement-local scope, not an
  outer variable — bare `$1` stays reserved, mesh having no positional `$1`). For a
  **computed** replacement, `NEW` may be a **lambda** taking the match — `:replaceall(/(\d+)/, func(m) { $m:int + 1 })` — the callback form, consistent with `:map` / `:filter` / `:each`.

*(Open sub-questions: the exact backref spelling (`${1}` vs `$1` inside the
replacement string), and whether a first-only variant is ever needed — it would be a
separate `:replace`, mirroring JavaScript's `replace` / `replaceAll` split — deferred
until a port needs it.)*

**String→number parse** *(decided — porting `total`, `bisect`)*. Values from argv /
`gets` / `$(…)` captures are **strings**, and numeric operations do not coerce
string operands (`n += "1"` fails when `n` is an int) with `<` / `>` comparing
strings *lexically*. This does not narrow the operators themselves: `+=` also
concatenates strings, extends lists, and merges maps, while `Duration` and
`Instant` have their arithmetic defined below. The
**`:int`** modifier parses a string to an integer, **fail-loud** — the inverse of
the canonical int→decimal rendering, erroring on non-numeric input rather than
silently yielding `0`. So `$line:words:get(0, "0"):int` sums a column and
`$good:int < $bad:int` compares numerically. *(A float type and a `:num` parse are
deferred — mesh has no non-integer number type today; add both together if the need
appears.)*

### Globbing

- `**` — recursive, **on by default** (no `globstar`-style opt-in).
- `*/`, `**/` — directories (trailing slash, existing muscle memory).
- **Qualifiers are the glob's argument list.** The `(...)` after a glob carries its
  **options**, the same comma grammar as any [value call](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas)
  — `*(...)` is sugar for `glob("*", ...)`. The options are **ANDed predicates** of
  three kinds:
  - **`type:`** — the file-type dimension, *mutually exclusive*: `type: file`,
    `type: dir`, `type: symlink`, or an alternation `type: file|dir` for "either." The
    `find -type` **letters are shorthand** — `f` ≡ `type: file`, `d` ≡ `type: dir`,
    `l` ≡ `type: symlink` (and the rarer `p s b c` for fifo/socket/block/char).
  - **boolean predicates** — orthogonal tests: `exec: true` (shorthand `x`),
    `empty: true`. A file can be executable *and* over a size, so these are independent
    booleans, not part of the exclusive `type:`.
  - **comparisons** — real predicate expressions with the type-directed operators,
    `size > 1M`, `age < 1d` (`>` / `<` read better than zsh's `+/-` age codes).

  ```
  *(type: file)             # long form
  *(f)                      # shorthand ≡ type: file
  *(f, x)                   # ≡ type: file, exec: true — executable files
  *(f, size > 1M)           # type + a comparison predicate
  *(type: file|dir)         # either type
  glob("*", type: file, size > 1M)   # the same options, via the function
  ```

  Qualifier arguments are evaluated once **per candidate path** in a dedicated
  predicate context. In that context `size`, `age`, `type`, `exec`, and `empty`
  are properties of the current candidate; they are not ordinary caller-scope
  names or expressions evaluated before `glob` starts. The literal and function
  forms use this same binding rule.

  There is also a terse **`:`-modifier** shorthand for the common single-type filter,
  usable on a glob *or* a plain list — `*:f` / `*:files` / `$paths:files`, so
  `*:f == *(f)` — which the engine **fuses** into matching, so `**:files` never
  materializes non-files.

- **These qualifiers are expansion-only.** `(f)` / `(d)` / `(x)` and the `size` /
  `age` / `empty` predicates all inspect the **filesystem**, so they belong to
  globbing (finding files), never to string matching. A `~` / `match` / `fnmatch`
  pattern uses only the plain glob metacharacters (`* ? [ ] { } **`), which need no
  disk: `$f ~ *.txt` tests the string alone, while `*(f)` / `*(size > 1M)` are
  meaningful only where real files exist to stat.

- **Exclusion** — a spaced infix `-`:

  ```
  *.txt - *.bak                     # everything but .bak
  **/*.js - **/node_modules/**      # recurse, skip a subtree (.gitignore case)
  *(f) - *.tmp                      # combine with qualifiers
  ```

  **Spaces are required.** Without them, `-` is ambiguous with the dashes that
  fill real filenames and globs (`*-min.js`, `2024-*-report`, `*-backup`).
  Requiring spaces removes that whole class, since nobody writes `foo - bar`
  with spaces in a filename. The only casualty is a lone stdin `-` sitting
  between globs, which is quoted as `'-'`. (This "operators need surrounding
  space" rule is general — every punctuation operator collides with something
  in filenames.)

- **Braces** — kept (`*.{jpg,png}`); universally understood.
- **ksh extended globs** (`!(…)`, `@(…)`, `+(…)`) — **dropped.** Cryptic, and
  their jobs are covered by braces + exclusion.

**The `glob()` family — globbing expands, matching is separate.** A glob's one job is
to **find files**: `glob(STR)` and the bare literal forms above are **eager** — they
touch the filesystem and hand back a plain [list](#arrays-lists) of matching paths.
There is no lazy "glob value"; a glob is either a **literal you write** or a **list you
got back**.

```
*.txt                     # bare literal → the matching paths (a list)
glob("*.log")             # same, but from a string  → a list
glob("src/**"):files      # recursion, then a type filter on the returned list
```

The two ergonomic wrappers are **expansion** helpers — they match now and return a
plain [list](#arrays-lists), so they read naturally in a `for`. They enumerate a
**directory's** immediate entries (`find -maxdepth 1`) filtered by type — reusing the
`files` / `dirs` words that name the same filter as the `:files` / `(f)`
[qualifiers](#modifiers):

```
files(DIR=.)              # files directly in DIR   (find DIR -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type f)
dirs(DIR=.)               # subdirectories of DIR   (find DIR -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d)

for f in files() { … }    # PWD by default
for d in dirs()  { … }
for f in files(src) { … } # a named directory
```

**Matching a string is a different operation.** Finding files (touches the disk) and
asking "does this *string* look like this pattern" (no disk at all) split the way
Python splits `glob` from `fnmatch`. The `~` operator carries the match side:
`$f ~ *.txt` is a bool — whole-string fnmatch, **no filesystem access** (see [Tests and
comparisons](#tests-and-comparisons)). A pattern built at runtime is matched by the
predicate directly — [`fnmatch($f, $pat)`](#built-ins) — so no first-class glob value
is needed to test against a computed pattern. (Regex keeps its `re(STR)` *value*
because regexes are complex and reused; a glob stays a literal or an `fnmatch` call.)

**A value never re-globs — and laziness is a thunk.** A pattern stored in a string is
inert; only a literal you *write* or an explicit `glob(…)` call touches the filesystem:

```
p = "*.jpg"               # a plain string — quoted, since a bare *.jpg would expand here
ls $p                     # passes the literal string *.jpg — a value never re-globs
ls ...glob($p)            # expand it now: glob() returns the list, ... splats it to argv
files = glob($p)          # or bind the list and reuse it
```

Because `glob()` is eager, deferring it needs no special lazy type — just wrap it in a
thunk: `later = func() { glob("*.txt") }` stores the *call*, and each `$later()` re-globs
against the **current** filesystem (fresh every time, which is what "lazy" is usually
for).

**Splatting to a command.** A bare literal in argument position splats its matches
straight into argv — `ls *.txt` is N arguments — because you wrote it there. Any glob
result you have **stored** (or got from `glob()` or a wrapper) is an ordinary **list**,
so handing it to an external takes the explicit [`...`](#spread--flattening) every list
does, or you iterate it:

```
ls *.txt                  # literal: splats in place, N argv entries
ls ...glob($pat)          # a runtime list → external: spread, as any list
for f in files(src) { }   # or iterate it — no spread needed
```

Daily globbing is the bare literal and needs no `...`; the spread shows up only for the
same case any stored list does — you stashed the list and want it as separate arguments.

**Functions look like functions.** `glob` / `files` / `dirs` are
[value calls](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas) — `files(.)`, parens attached — never
bare `files .`, so at a glance a glob **function** stays distinct from an external
**command** even in statement position.

**Two policies the primitive pins.** `*` matches *everything not hidden* — files,
dirs, and symlinks alike — and is deliberately **not** narrowed to files-only (else
`cp -r * dst` would silently skip subdirectories, a fresh footgun traded for the old
one); the file / dir / special split lives entirely in the `(f)` / `(d)` / `:files`
vocabulary. A hidden (leading-dot) entry matches only when the corresponding **path
component** of the pattern itself begins with a literal `.` — the usual per-component
rule, so `*` skips `.git` while `.*` and `src/.*` match it. **No-match:** an expansion
that matches nothing is the empty list `[]` (programmatic use never throws) — and since
globbing is eager there is no stored pattern to disagree with that; a bare *literal*
matching nothing in command position **warns but does not error** — it expands to
nothing rather than passing the literal through (bash's footgun). *(TODO —
interactively, **prompt** on no match instead of only warning.)*

### Variables and assignment

Assignment is `name=value`, the **bash spelling** — the most ingrained shell
reflex, kept. A bare `name=value` (a statement that is *just* that) binds a
variable, unspaced, exactly like bash. The identical `word=value` token as an
**argument** — anywhere after a command word — stays an ordinary literal
(`git commit --author=me`, `env FOO=1 cmd`), so **position** separates
assignment from data, precisely as shell users already expect. No
`set` / `let` / `var` keyword needed.

A **spaced** `name = value` is also accepted, and is the form to reach for when
the value has internal spaces — a list, a glob, an `if` — where the unspaced
form would be awkward to read. Two things mesh does *not* fold in, to stay
unambiguous: bash's prefix-env form (`FOO=1 cmd` in one breath) is written
`env FOO=1 cmd` here, and a bare leading `name=value` is always a *shell*
binding, never a one-command temporary.

```
foo=bar                   # assignment — bash-style, unspaced
n=42
env FOO=1 cmd             # NOT assignment: FOO=1 is a literal arg to `env`
git commit --author=me    # NOT assignment: a k=v arg after the command word

xs = [a b c]              # spaced form for a compound value (list)
files = *.txt             # a glob result (list)
greeting = if $french { bonjour } else { hi }
```

**`$` reads, bare binds or runs.** A leading `$` means *read this variable*
(`$x`, `$f:stem`). A **bare** name is either being *bound* — the left of `=`, a
`for` binder, a function parameter — or, in command position, is a *command or
function to run*. So the same name changes form with what you do to it:

```
f = report.txt            # bind f        (bare, LHS of =)
echo $f                   # read f        ($)
for f in *(f) { … $f … }  # bind f, then read $f  (same as = / $x)

if ready { … }            # run the `ready` command/predicate, branch on status
if $ready { … }           # read the variable `ready`, branch on its bool
```

This is the familiar shell split, kept deliberately: the only names *without* a
`$` are the ones you are defining or the commands you are calling. Its one
hazard — forgetting the `$` and running a command by accident — is softened
because an unknown bareword is a **command-not-found error**, not a silent
misread.

**Names are kebab-case.** Identifiers — variables *and* command/function names
alike — may contain hyphens (`last-cmd-time`, `auto-fetch`, `host-seg`), matching
Unix command names (`ssh-add`, `docker-compose`) and the Lisp tradition. There is
no clash with the minus operator because of the [operators-need-spaces](#globbing)
rule: `-` is subtraction / exclusion *only* with surrounding spaces. So `a-b` is
one name, `a - b` subtracts, and `$a-$b` interpolates the two with a literal
hyphen between — the third payoff of that one spacing rule.

- **Scope — two levels, lexical.** There are exactly two variable scopes: the
  **session-global** scope (top-level rc and interactive bindings) and a fresh
  **function-local** scope per `func` call. The environment (exported names) is
  a separate axis. Scoping is **lexical**: a function sees its own locals, its
  parameters, and the globals — never its *caller's* locals (no dynamic scope,
  the classic shell footgun). Inside a function, `x = 5` binds a **local by
  default**, shadowing any global rather than clobbering it — the deliberate
  inverse of bash's assign-to-global default. To write a session-global from
  within a function, say so explicitly:

  ```
  count = 0                 # global (top level)
  func tick() {
    n = 1                   # a NEW function-local, gone on return
    global count = $count + 1   # explicitly updates the session-global
  }
  ```

  Reading resolves **outward** (local → global); an **unbound** name is an
  **error**, not empty — the always-on `set -u` that the *no null* rule below
  already implies, so a **typo'd read fails loud** (`$staus` → error). The one
  place a typo is *not* caught is **assignment**, which always creates
  (`staus = 5` binds a new var) — the cost of having no `let`/`var` keyword;
  reads carry the fail-loud guarantee, writes create. The **total read** for a
  maybe-unset name is the same `:get`
  that maps use, because the **environment is a first-class map named `env`**:

  ```
  editor = $env:get(EDITOR, vim)  # total: value, or "vim" if unset — never errors
  $env.EDITOR                   # strict: errors if unset (like any $m.key)
  if $env:has(SSH_AUTH_SOCK) { … }
  ```

  So `$env.EDITOR` (a strict read) errors when unset, and `$env:get(EDITOR, vim)`
  is the safe defaulting form — no new syntax, just the map surface applied to
  the environment.
- **No block scope; `unset` removes a scope's binding.** Control-flow blocks
  (`if` / `for` / `while` / `loop`) do **not** open a new scope, so
  `if c { x = 1 }` then `$x` works and a loop binder is an ordinary binding in
  the enclosing scope (readable after the loop, holding the last value) — the
  model stays two levels, no more. **`unset name`** removes the binding **in the
  current scope**: inside a function it drops the local, and if that local was
  shadowing a global the global becomes visible again (reads resolve outward as
  usual) — so plain `unset` never reaches through to mutate a global, matching
  the `global`-to-escape rule. To remove a session-global from within a function,
  **`global unset name`** (symmetric with `global name = value`). A read errors
  only when the name is unbound in *every* visible scope. `unset x` differs from
  `x = ""`: the latter is *bound to the empty string*, the former *unbound* — the
  two states that stand in for a missing null. **`unset` also deletes a
  collection element** — `unset $m[key]` / `unset $m.key` removes that map entry
  (and `unset $xs[i]` removes the element and closes the gap); deleting a missing
  key is a **no-op**, not an error, so `unset $sh.prompt.auth` is idempotent whether
  or not the segment was registered.
- **Command/function names resolve at call time** — a separate namespace from
  variables. A bare word in command position (`g` inside `func f { g }`) is a
  *command or function* looked up **when `f` runs**, not when `f` is defined. So
  definition order is irrelevant: define helpers in any order, forward-reference
  freely, mutual recursion just works, and an rc file reads top-to-bottom with no
  forward declarations. If `g` is still undefined when `f` actually runs, that is
  the ordinary command-not-found **error** at that point. Only *variable* scope
  is lexical; the value namespace and the command namespace are distinct, as in
  every shell.
- **Export.** `export NAME = value` puts a name in the process environment for
  children. **Only byte-strings can be exported** — the environment is a flat
  `KEY=bytes` table, so a list or map cannot cross an `exec` boundary. Exporting
  a list is an error with a clear message (join it first: `export P =
  $dirs:join(":")`). **The one exception is path-type variables** —
  `$env.PATH` and friends are lists *by design* and the shell **auto-`:`-joins**
  them on export (splitting on read); that is a defined serialization for the
  known `:`-delimited path vars, not a general "lists become strings" rule, so an
  arbitrary list still errors. The path-type set is a **fixed built-in list** —
  `PATH`, `MANPATH`, `CDPATH`, `INFOPATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, and
  the like — plus an **opt-in** for any other name: **`export --list NAME`** marks
  a name as a `:`-delimited list, so it is split-on-import and joined-on-export
  just like the built-ins (`export --list MY_TOOL_PATH` reclassifies an inbound
  value in place; `export --list MY_TOOL_PATH = [/a /b]` declares and sets). The
  separator is fixed to `:`. *(TODO: consider a dedicated `declare --list NAME`
  spelling instead — it reads as its own statement, at the cost of adding a
  builtin; `export --list` is chosen for now because it needs no new builtin and
  lives exactly where the join-on-export exception already does.)* One further
  restriction: environment entries are
  **NUL-terminated**, so a byte-string containing an embedded NUL (which a
  `$(cmd):raw` capture can) **cannot** be exported either — that too is a hard
  error, not a silent truncation. This keeps the rich types honest: they live
  *in* the shell, and the boundary to external programs is always
  (NUL-free) bytes.

  **Export is a global effect on the `env` map**, not a local-by-default
  binding: `export NAME = value` (even inside a function) writes the session
  environment and **persists after return** — export exists precisely to change
  what *children* inherit, so scoping it locally would defeat the point. This is
  the one deliberate exception to local-by-default, and it is explicit (you typed
  `export`). A plain **local shadow does not touch the environment**: inside a
  function, `PATH = …` binds an in-shell local that only that function sees;
  children still inherit the *exported* `env[PATH]` until you `export` (or
  `global`-assign an already-exported name). For a **temporary** env change
  around a single command, `env NAME=val cmd` stays the idiom; a whole function
  scoping-and-restoring the environment is the deferred *isolation* question
  (see [Open questions](#open-questions)).
- **Types are inferred, not declared.** `x = foo` is a string, `x = [a b c]` a
  list, `x = [a: 1]` a map. There is no type sigil (`@`, `%`) on the *name* —
  a variable just holds whatever value it was given, and `$x` reads it back.
  Perl-style sigils (`@PATH` a list, `$PATH` a scalar) were considered and
  rejected: a variable's type here is the *value's* business, not the name's, so
  a name-baked sigil would lie the moment a var is reassigned a different shape —
  and Perl's context-varying sigil (where `$foo[0]` indexes the array `@foo`) is
  a notorious footgun. `$name` means one thing everywhere: "read this variable."
- **String interpolation.** Inside `"…"`, unbraced member access and integer
  indexing work exactly as they do outside strings: `"$m.key"` and `"$xs[0]"`.
  Braces remain available for the same references and delimit them when literal
  text could otherwise be consumed as access: `"${m.key}"`, `"${xs[0]}"`,
  `"${file}.txt"`, `"${dir}s"`. General expressions also use `${…}`.
- **No null.** mesh has **no `nil`/`null`/`none`** value — the billion-dollar
  mistake is left out. The consequence is a consistent rule wherever a value
  might be absent: **exact** access fails loud (`$xs[99]`, `$m[absent]` are
  errors), **total** access takes a default (`$xs:get(i, d)`, `$m:get(k, d)`), and
  a **control-flow gap** yields the empty string (a no-`else` `if`). Nothing
  silently returns a null that has to be checked for downstream. *(open — the
  one genuine fork this leaves: is a first-class absent value ever worth adding
  back for, e.g., "key present but unset"? Current answer: no; `:has` +
  `:get(key, default)` cover it.)*

**Special variables live in two namespace maps** — the *(decided)* way to keep
the shell's built-in state out of your variable namespace. The whole lowercase
top-level is **yours**; the built-ins hang off two reserved roots:

- **`$env`** — the process environment, accessed by name: `$env.EDITOR`,
  `$env.HOME`. **`$env.PATH` is a list** — `$env.PATH += /opt/bin`,
  `$env.PATH:dedup`, `$env.PATH:has(/usr/bin)` all just work, which is the
  "guarded, deduped PATH" requirement. Because the OS environment is bytes, a
  path-type entry is `:`-joined on the way out and split on the way in (see the
  [export exception](#variables-and-assignment) below); the other built-in path
  vars (`MANPATH`, `CDPATH`, `INFOPATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, …) are
  lists too, and `export --list NAME` opts any other name in. Path-var splitting is
  **exact** — it keeps *every* empty component (leading, interior, trailing),
  *not* the trailing-empty-trimming [capture split](#modifiers), because an empty
  component is meaningful (`PATH=/usr/bin:` means "…and the cwd") and a
  split→join round-trip must be byte-faithful.
- **`$sh`** — everything else the shell owns, **flat**: runtime values —
  **`$sh.status`** (last exit, int `0`–`255`, the readable replacement for `$?`),
  **`$sh.pipestatus`** (a **list** of the last pipeline's stage statuses, where
  real lists beat bash's `PIPESTATUS`), `$sh.pid` / `$sh.ppid` (own and parent PID,
  bash's `$$` / `$PPID`), `$sh.version`, `$sh.options`,
  `$sh.interactive`, the **stream handles** `$sh.stdin` / `$sh.stdout` / `$sh.stderr`
  (each with a `:tty` test — the `test -t N` replacement), **`$sh.jobs`** (the live
  [job-control](#job-control) map),
  and **`$sh.args`** / **`$sh.name`** (script/positional args as a list, and the
  shell-or-script name — see [Startup](#startup-and-invocation)); **and the
  hooks** — `$sh.prompt`, `$sh.preprompt`,
  `$sh.preexec` / `$sh.postexec`, `$sh.precd` / `$sh.postcd`, `$sh.exit`
  ([Hooks and the prompt](#hooks-and-the-prompt)), the **`$sh.complete`**
  [completion-override](#completion) map, and the **`$sh.signal`**
  [signal-handler](#signals) map.

So there are exactly **two reserved names** (`env`, `sh`); every other lowercase
name is entirely yours — a var called `status`, `prompt`, or `path` never
clashes. Access is strict [map access](#maps-associative-arrays), so `$sh:keys`
lists the whole surface and a mistyped key fails loud.

**Read-only vs. writable within `$sh`.** The **runtime** entries (`$sh.status`,
`$sh.pipestatus`, `$sh.pid`, `$sh.ppid`, `$sh.version`, `$sh.interactive`, the
`$sh.stdin` / `$sh.stdout` / `$sh.stderr` handles, `$sh.jobs` with
its records, and `$sh.args` / `$sh.name`) are the shell's authoritative state —
**read-only**: assigning or `unset`ting one is an error, so config can't corrupt
an invariant. (`$sh.jobs` changes only through `&` / `fg` / `bg` / `kill` and job
completion, never by mutating the map directly — you still *read* it freely, e.g.
`$sh.jobs:len`.) The **configuration** entries are yours to
write: the hook maps (`$sh.prompt`, `$sh.preprompt`, …), the `$sh.options`
settings map, the `$sh.complete` [completion-override](#completion) map, and the
`$sh.signal` [signal-handler](#signals) map.
(This is the one place the general map rules are constrained — individual keys
carry a mutability flag.)

*(TODO: **indirect / by-name variable access.** Real configs reach a value through
a *computed* name — fish's `my_set_color` does `eval "printf \$$arg"` to read the
variable named by `$arg` (`bold`, `blue`, …); bash has `${!var}` and `declare -n`,
zsh the `${(P)var}` flag, ksh namerefs (`typeset -n`). mesh has **no** by-name access
to the variable
namespace, deliberately so far — the intended answer is to put such values in a
**map** and index it (`$colors[$name]`), which is first-class and needs no `eval`.
Because `$env` / `$sh` are already maps, indirect *environment* access falls out
for free (`$env[$name]`). Open question: is a map always enough, or is a narrow
by-name facility (read, perhaps write) warranted for genuine metaprogramming?
Leaning: maps only — revisit only if a real need survives the reframe.)*

### Quoting and escaping

mesh has a few string forms — a bare word, three quote kinds (`"…"`, `'…'`, `r'…'`),
and a heredoc — plus the backslash escape, chosen so the common cases need no
ceremony and the rules stay few.

**Bare words are literal** (`x = foo` binds `"foo"`), and a single **backslash
escapes the next character** so one metacharacter can go literal without reaching
for quotes: `cp a\ b dst` (a literal space keeps it one argument), `\*` (a literal
star, not a glob), `\$`, `\#`, `\!`, `\-`. A `\` at end of line is **line
continuation**.

**Single quotes `'…'` don't interpolate but do escape** — they are `"…"` minus `$`
interpolation (Python's `str`). The escape set is the double-quote set with the quote
swapped: `\n \t \r \e \\ \'` and `\u{…}`; `$` is always literal (no `\$` needed), and
an **unknown escape is an error** (`'\d'` is a mistake, not a literal backslash-d).
So `'can\'t'` → `can't`, `'a\nb'` is two lines, and no variable expands.

**Raw strings `r'…'` / `r"…"` take no escapes at all** — every byte is literal and
the delimiter is the only special character — so they are the home for regex source
and paths: `r'\d+\.txt'` is exactly those bytes and `r'C:\x'` is a Windows path. Pick
the delimiter that avoids your content's quote — `r"can't \d+"` holds an apostrophe
freely — and a string needing **both** quote kinds uses the quoted-delimiter
[heredoc](#redirection).

**Double quotes `"…"` interpolate and escape.** `$name` / `${…}`
[interpolate](#variables-and-assignment), and a **modern C-style escape set**
applies — `\n \t \r \e \\ \" \$` and `\u{1F600}` for Unicode — so `"a\nb"` is two
lines and `"\$5"` is a literal dollar. This is a deliberate break from bash (where
`"\n"` is a backslash-n and you reach for `$'\n'`): mesh needs no `$'…'` form
because double quotes already interpret escapes.

**Adjacent pieces concatenate** into one word — `"$dir"/'sub'/$file` fuses into a
single path and `--flag='some value'` is one argument — so literals and expansions
compose without a `+`.

*(decided: the raw form that can itself hold *both* quote kinds — for the rare
string embedding `'` and `"` with no escaping — is a **quoted-delimiter heredoc**
(`<< 'END' … END`; the bare `<< END` interpolates, see [Redirection](#redirection)),
chosen over an `r#"…"#` delimiter; see [`TODO.md`](TODO.md). Its *value-producing*
spelling is still unspecified — today's heredoc is command-redirection only —
tracked in TODO.md.)*

**Regex literals stay `/…/`; absolute paths are disambiguated by word shape**
*(decided direction — the raw-string alternative is recorded under "Alternatives
considered" below)*. mesh keeps the familiar `/…/` regex literal and resolves the one
real problem it creates — an absolute path or glob also begins with `/` — with a
**word-shape rule**, replacing the blunt "any leading slash in a match slot is a
regex."

In a **match slot** (the `~` / `!~` RHS, a `:match` argument, the replace family's
`OLD` argument — `:replaceall` / `:replacestart` / `:replaceend` — a `match` arm), a word
beginning with `/` is a **regex** *only* when its **base** — the word stripped of any
trailing recognized `:` flag modifiers — is a clean `/BODY/`: the closing `/` is the
final character of the base and `BODY` has no unescaped interior `/`. So `/\d+/:i` is
a regex (base `/\d+/`, then `:i`). Every other leading-`/` word is a **path or
glob**:

| RHS word | reads as | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/error/`, `/^\d+$/`, `/a\|b/` | **regex** | clean `/BODY/`, no interior `/` |
| `/a\/b/` | **regex** `a/b` | interior slash escaped |
| `/usr/bin` | **path** | interior `/` before the end |
| `/usr/*/bin` | **glob** (absolute) | interior `/` ⇒ path shape |
| `/tmp/*` | **glob** | the closing-looking `/` isn't final |
| `/tmp` | **path** | no closing `/` |
| `/*.txt` | **glob** at root | leading `/`, no closing `/` |

The win over the old rule: **absolute globs and paths need no wrapper** —
`$p ~ /tmp/*` and `$p ~ /usr/bin` just work, where before *every* absolute pattern
had to be wrapped.

**The one residual.** A single segment with a trailing slash still reads as a regex:
`$p ~ /tmp/` is the regex `tmp`, not the path. Three teachable outs — drop the slash
(`$p ~ /tmp`, the path, and the more usual spelling anyway), add structure
(`$p ~ /tmp/*`), or force it (`fnmatch($p, "/tmp/")` / `== "/tmp/"`). That is the entire
residual, versus the old rule's blanket wrapper requirement.

**Recognized only in match slots.** Everywhere else a `/…/` word stays a path or
string — `cd /tmp/`, `grep /usr/bin`, `p = /etc/hosts`. In particular an
**assignment** `x = /…/` binds the **path string**, not a regex: extending
regex-literal recognition into general value position was considered and **not
chased** — it would split `x = /tmp/` from `cd /tmp/` inconsistently, and buys only
sugar over `re("…")`. To bind a **regex value** to a name, use the constructor with a
raw string, `pat = re(r'\d+')` (a plain `'\d+'` is a Model B error — `\d` is an
unknown escape).

**Settled independent of the literal syntax:** regex flags are `:` modifiers on the
regex value — `/\d+/:i`, `:m`, `:s`, `:x` (see the note by `re()`; parse-affecting
flags like `:x` are construction-time).

**Alternatives considered (explored, not taken).** Sketched while hunting for a rule
with *zero* edge cases; the word-shape rule above accepts one narrow residual
instead. Kept as the record and as possible future sugar:

- **`rx'…'` as a regex literal replacing `/…/`.** The Python-shaped string trio —
  `"…"`, `'…'` (non-interpolating but escaped), `r'…'` / `r"…"` (raw) — **was
  adopted** (see [Quoting](#quoting-and-escaping) above); what was *not* taken is
  spelling the **regex literal** as `rx'…'` (raw body → regex value,
  `rx'\d+' ≡ re(r'\d+')`) with `/` then always a path/glob. `/…/` is kept instead.
  Still, `rx'…'` remains the clean way to write a regex *value* in a non-match
  position (`pat = rx'\d+'`: no `$`-anchor issue, no path ambiguity), so it may
  return as sugar for `re(r'…')`.
- **`~` / `match` RHS coercion** *(decided: no coercion, for now)*. A plain string on
  the RHS stays an **error**; a regex must be explicit (`/…/` or `re($pat)`) — the
  no-silent-coercion rule (below) holds. The two coercion flavors were weighed and
  neither adopted: *string → regex* ("like `match`": terse, but inverts the universal
  "quotes mean literal" and risks `$x ~ 'a.b'` matching `axb`), and
  *quotes-mean-literal* (`'…'` inert, regex only via `re` / `/…/`). Revisitable.
- **Removing the two single-quote escapes.** The thread's original question — the old
  design made `'…'` raw with only `\'` / `\\`, and asked whether to drop those to make
  it *fully* raw. Overtaken by adopting Model B: `'…'` is now the *escaped*
  non-interpolating string (so `\'` is simply part of a full escape set), and rawness
  lives in `r'…'`. No longer open.

### Arrays (lists)

The list is mesh's core value — command substitutions already produce lists
(see [Command substitution](#command-substitution)) and value modifiers already
map over them. This section pins down the *literal*, *indexing*, and *slicing*
surface.

```
xs = [a b c d]            # literal: space-separated, like nushell / elvish
empty = []
one = [solo]             # a 1-element list, never collapsed to a scalar
```

**Zero-based**, always — matching bash/Python/Rust and rejecting zsh's
1-based indexing (the single biggest cross-shell gotcha). Negative indices
count from the end.

```
$xs[0]                    # a           first
$xs[-1]                   # d           last  (negative index)
$xs[1]                    # b
```

**Ergonomic length and ends** are *words*, consistent with the modifier system
— no `${#arr[@]}` and no `$#arr`:

| Form | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$xs:len` | `4` | element count |
| `$xs:first` | `a` | same as `$xs[0]` |
| `$xs:last` | `d` | same as `$xs[-1]`; the two spellings coexist on purpose |
| `$xs:rest` | `[b c d]` | all but the first |
| `$xs:init` | `[a b c]` | all but the last |

`last` gets **two spellings** deliberately: `$xs[-1]` for anyone with the
Python/zsh reflex, `$xs:last` for readability and for the case where `$xs` is
itself an expression you don't want to index twice.

**Slices** use ranges. mesh is written in Rust, so it adopts Rust's range
spelling directly — `..` is **half-open** (end-exclusive), `..=` is inclusive:

```
$xs[1..3]                 # [b c]       indices 1,2   (half-open)
$xs[1..=3]                # [b c d]     indices 1,2,3 (inclusive)
$xs[..2]                  # [a b]       first two
$xs[2..]                  # [c d]       from 2 to end
$xs[-2..]                 # [c d]       last two
```

Half-open is the default because `[..n]` then reads as "the first `n`", and
`[i..j]` has length `j - i` — the two properties that make off-by-one bugs
rare. Reach for `..=` when you literally mean "up to and including."

**Empty and out-of-range** — mesh has **no null value**, so every accessor has a
defined result rather than a silent `nil`. The rule follows Python/Rust: exact
access is **strict** (fail loud), range access is **lenient** (clamp), and a
**total** accessor with a default is the ergonomic safe path.

| Access | On empty / out of range | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$xs[i]` (exact index) | **error** | asking for element `i` that isn't there is a bug, not a `""` |
| `$xs:first` / `$xs:last` | **error** on empty | no first/last element exists |
| `$xs:rest` / `$xs:init` | **`[]`** | "all but one" of a 0- or 1-element list is genuinely empty — total, no error |
| `$xs[a..b]` (slice) | **clamped** | `$xs[2..99]` → to the end; `$xs[5..]` on a short list → `[]` (a range is a request, a partial answer is fine) |
| `$xs:get(i, default)` | returns `default` | total, never errors — the safe accessor when absence is expected |

So `$xs[99]` on a 4-element list is an error that names the index, but
`$xs:get(99, "-")` yields `"-"`, and `$xs[1..99]` just runs to the end. Fail loud
where a missing element means a mistake; stay total where absence is normal.

**Build** goes through the spread operator `...` (see
[Spread](#spread--flattening) below), so there is one primitive for assembling
lists:

```
xs = [...$xs e]           # append e
xs = [pre ...$xs]         # prepend
both = [...$a ...$b]      # concatenate
```

**Append in place** is `+=`, terse in the common cases, with no `push` verb and
no unfamiliar operator (a `<<`-style shovel was considered and rejected — not
widely known, and it collides with heredocs). It is defined by **both operands —
the left-hand type first, then the right** — so every combination has one
answer:

| LHS | RHS | `+=` does | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| list | list | **extend** by its elements | Python/Ruby `+=` |
| list | scalar or map | **append** as one element | a list may hold any value |
| map | map | **merge** (right side wins on key clash) | |
| map | non-map | **error** | no key to merge a bare value under |
| string | string | **concatenate** | a [styled value](#hooks-and-the-prompt) counts as its text here → plain-string concatenate |
| int | int | **add** | |
| bool | bool | **error** | `+=` has no meaning on bools — use `or` / `and` |
| scalar | mismatched scalar type | **error** | no coercion (`n += "x"` fails) |

```
hosts += web3             # list  += scalar : append one   -> [...$hosts web3]
xs    += [d e f]          # list  += list   : extend by three
xs    += $more            # list  += list   : extend by a list
m     += [key: value]     # map   += map    : insert / update
greeting += "!"           # string += string: concatenate
n += 1                    # int   += int    : add
```

For the common **list** LHS this is the ergonomic rule you'd expect — a list on
the right extends, anything else appends as one element. Why it is safe and not
a bash-style "word or list?" trap: mesh values
are **typed with no coercion** — a scalar `x` and the one-element list `[x]`
are distinct and stay that way — so the dispatch is *determinate and knowable*,
never inferred from whitespace. Two properties follow:

- **The single-append case has no wrong answer.** For a scalar `e`, `xs += e`
  (append) and `xs += [e]` (extend-by-one) both yield `[...$xs e]`. They only
  diverge when the RHS is genuinely a list — which is exactly when you mean
  extend.
- **Nesting stays expressible** by bracketing: `xs += [$ys]` is a one-element
  list whose element is `$ys`, so it appends `$ys` *whole* (one nested
  element), while `xs += $ys` extends and `xs += [...$ys]` forces extend. The
  bracket is the explicit control when a variable's arity is unknown.

This is the **one place the shell flattens by type rather than by an explicit
`...`** — confined to the `+=` right-hand side, type-directed not
whitespace-directed, so it does not reintroduce word-splitting.

*(TODO: consider a symmetric **`-=`** that removes an element — `$hosts -= web3`
deleting the matching element, mirroring how `+=` appends one. Open: remove the
first match or every match; equality by value; whether the right-hand type
dispatches like `+=` (a list RHS removing each of its elements → set-difference,
a scalar removing one), and what a map LHS means (`-= key` dropping that entry,
overlapping with `unset $m.key`). Note this is a value-level remove-by-content,
distinct from `unset $xs[i]`, which deletes by index.)*

*(TODO: consider modifier-form **`:add`** / **`:remove`** (or similar names) as
the **pure** counterparts to the mutating `+=` / `-=` — `$xs:add(e)` returning a
new list with `e` appended and `$xs:remove(e)` returning one with the matching
element gone, so they compose in a modifier chain (`$env.PATH:remove(/usr/games):dedup`)
and read as expressions rather than statements. Open: the exact names, whether
they mirror `+=`'s type-directed dispatch, and how they line up with the existing
`:map` / `:filter` transforms.)*

### Maps (associative arrays)

A map literal is a bracket literal whose entries are **`key: value` pairs**,
comma-separated. The discriminator between a map and a list is the **pair
syntax**, not the comma — so a singleton `[a: 1]` is unambiguously a map. The
comma is merely the separator *between* entries; the space separates *list*
elements.

```
ports = [http: 80, https: 443, ssh: 22]
one   = [a: 1]            # a map: the `key: value` pair makes it one
empty = [:]               # the empty map  (`[]` is the empty list)
```

Precisely: a `[...]` literal is a **map** iff it contains at least one
`key: value` pair **or is the empty-map form `[:]`**, and then **every** entry
must be a pair — mixing pair and bare-value entries (`[a: 1 lone]`) is an error,
not a hybrid. `[:]` is the sole zero-entry map (a bare `:` standing in for "the
pairs that would be here"); `[]` is the empty list. A list element
that needs a literal colon is quoted (`["http:" 80]`), which also keeps this
rule from colliding with the modifier `:` (only a modifier *keyword* after `:`
triggers a modifier; `key: value` has a value, so it stays a pair).

**Keys are byte-strings**, always — the same type the environment and argv use,
so there is no key-equality question to answer and no list/map keys to compare
structurally. A key in a literal is a bareword or quoted string (`http`,
`"a b"`); a numeric-looking key is just those bytes (`[200: ok]` keys on the
string `"200"`, and `$m[200]` looks up the same); and an interpolation in key
position uses its **string value** (`[$name: 1]`, `$m[$k]`). A non-string value
used as a key — a list or map — is an **error**, not silently stringified. This
keeps maps to the one job an rc file needs: string-keyed lookup tables.

**Duplicate keys** in one literal (`[a: 1, a: 2]`, or interpolated keys that
collide) resolve **last-value-wins, first-position** — the later value is kept
(`2`), and the key stays at the position of its first appearance. That is the
same "right side wins" as `+=` merge, and it keeps insertion order stable so map
iteration is unaffected by a later overwrite. It is never an error, so building
a map by overriding earlier defaults just works.

Access mirrors list indexing exactly — `$m[key]` for a string key is the same
shape as `$arr[0]` for an integer index:

```
$ports[https]             # 443
$ports[https] = 8443      # set / update
```

**Dot sugar.** When the key is a bareword identifier, `$m.key` is sugar for
`$m[key]` — the record-style access every language has, and much nicer for
config-shaped maps and the [hook maps](#hooks-and-the-prompt) below:

```
$ports.https              # == $ports[https]
$config.editor = vim
```

Brackets stay for dynamic or non-identifier keys (`$m[$k]`, `$m["a b"]`). Dot
access has the same meaning inside and outside a double-quoted string, so
`"$m.key"` reads the map member. Use braces when a dot starts literal text:
`"${file}.txt"`.

| Form | Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$m:keys` | list | keys (insertion order preserved) |
| `$m:values` | list | values |
| `$m:len` | int | entry count (same word as lists) |
| `$m:has(KEY)` | bool | membership — the decided spelling |
| `$m:get(KEY, default)` | value | total lookup — `default` when absent |

**Membership is `:has`.** The terser `?` postfix (`$m[key]?`) was considered and
dropped — it fights the "words, not punctuation" grain the modifiers are built
on, and spends a `?` symbol that optional/error-handling will likely want. *(to
do: consider an infix `in` operator — `if https in $ports { … }` — as an
additional, English-reading spelling alongside `:has`; familiar from Python, but
it adds a second way to phrase the same test, so weigh it before adding.)*

**Missing keys** follow the same strict/total split as list access, since mesh
has no null: `$m[absent]` is an **error** (a bad key is usually a typo in
config, and should fail loud, not silently yield `""`), while `$m:get(key,
default)` is the total form that returns `default` when the key is absent, and
`if $m:has(key) { … }` is the guard. So a dynamic lookup that may legitimately
miss is written `$m:get($name, unknown)`, never a bare `$m[$name]`.

Insertion order is **preserved** (like Python dict / a `Vec<(K,V)>` behind the
scenes) so `for k in $m:keys` is deterministic — important for an rc file that
builds, say, an ordered alias table.

### Spread / flattening

`...` is the one operator that moves between "a list" and "several arguments,"
in both directions:

- **At a call site**, `...$xs` **explodes** a **list** into separate positional
  arguments — or a **map** into named options, each `key: value` pair binding the `key`
  option (the two shapes a call takes; see
  [Calling for a value](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas)). A **list** spread reaches an
  **external** command as plain argv tokens, but a **map** spread binds *named options*
  and so needs a signature — spreading a map to an external is an **error** (a map has
  no canonical argv encoding — mesh will not guess `--k=v` vs `--k v` vs `k=v`), the
  same bytes-boundary rule that rejects an un-spread list at the process edge.
- **In a signature**, `...name` **collects** trailing arguments into a list.

```
git log ...$flags         # each element of $flags becomes its own argv entry
cp ...$srcs $dest         # spread in the middle is fine
```

This is the crux of mesh's **no-word-splitting** promise: a bare `$xs` passed
to a command stays **one value, a list** — flattening into argv only happens
where you *write* `...`. That inverts the bash default (everything splits unless
you fight it with quotes) into opt-in — the footgun becomes a deliberate
keystroke.

What "stays a list" means depends on where the value lands, because argv for an
external program is bytes, not mesh values:

- **To an in-shell `func`**, the list arrives intact as one parameter — the
  callee sees a real list and can index it, `:len` it, spread it onward.
- **To an external program**, there is no list-shaped argv slot, so passing an
  un-spread list is a **hard error** (`git log $flags` → *"$flags is a list;
  spread it with ...$flags or join it with $flags:join"*). mesh refuses to
  silently pick a separator — that guess is exactly the bash footgun. The two
  explicit outs are `...$flags` (one argv entry per element) and
  `$flags:join(SEP)` (one byte-string).

The general rule at the bytes boundary — **a value renders to argv iff it has a
*canonical* byte form; if rendering it would require a *guess*, that is an
error**:

| Value | Crosses to argv as | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| string (NUL-free) | itself | already bytes |
| int (`$xs:len`, `n = 42`) | decimal digits — `echo $xs:len` → `4` | decimal is canonical, not a choice |
| bool (a switch, a comparison) | `true` / `false` | two fixed spellings, unambiguous |
| styled value (from `style`) | its **text** (attributes dropped), then the string rows apply | a styled value *is* a string with display metadata, so an embedded NUL in its text is the same hard error as below |
| **string with embedded NUL** | **error** | argv entries are NUL-terminated; the OS cannot carry it (same limit as `export`) |
| **list** | **error** — spread or `:join` | no canonical separator (space? tab? `,`?) |
| **map** | **error** — render it explicitly | no canonical flattening at all |
| Duration | its canonical spelling (`3s`, `1m30s`) | it has a canonical form |
| **Instant / regex / stream handle** | **error** — no canonical byte form | an Instant needs `:iso`/`:epoch`/`:format`; a regex (it carries flags) and a stream handle have no byte form at all |

String interpolation uses this same rendering table. Interpolating a list, map,
Instant, regex, stream handle, embedded-NUL string, or any future value without a
canonical byte form is a loud error; `${…}` is not an alternate serialization
mechanism.

An embedded NUL (which a `$(cmd):raw` capture can hold) is the one place a
*string* fails to cross — argv, like the environment, is NUL-terminated, so it
is a hard error at both boundaries, never a silent truncation.

So `echo $xs:len` prints `4` and `echo $found` prints `true`, but `echo $xs`
(a list) and `echo $m` (a map) are errors that name the fix. The dividing line
is "is there one obviously-right rendering?" — ints and bools have one, a list's
separator and a map's shape do not.

### Destructuring

Binding several names from a list in one step reuses the **list-literal syntax on
the left**. So splitting a string into variables — bash's `read a b c` — is just
*split then destructure*, and there is no monolithic `read` built-in:

```
[user pass uid gid home shell] = $line:split(":")   # a passwd line into fields
[k v]           = gets():split("=")                 # read a line, split on =, bind two
[first ...rest] = $args                            # ...rest absorbs the remainder as a list
[a b ...mid z]  = $xs                              # ends pinned; mid is everything between
[_ _ uid]       = $line:split(":")                  # _ discards a field
```

- **`...rest`** absorbs the remaining elements as a list (possibly empty) — the
  variable-length case; it may sit anywhere, with fixed names on either side.
- **`_`** discards that position — the same wildcard [`match`](#matching-match) uses.
- **A length mismatch is an error** unless a `...rest` is present, consistent with
  [no null](#variables-and-assignment): a missing field is a bug, not a silent
  empty. This is cleaner than bash's `read`, where the last variable silently soaks
  up the leftover — here you write `...rest` when you mean it.
- **A failed destructure binds nothing** — shape and length are validated against
  the RHS *before* any name is committed, so `[a b c] = $two_items` errors with
  `a`/`b`/`c` left at their prior values (or unbound), never half-updated. The
  assignment is atomic: all names take their new values or none do.

**The pattern grammar is shared with [`match`](#matching-match).** A bare
destructuring assignment is the *unconditional* use ("I know the shape — bind it");
a **`match` arm** is the *conditional* use — branch on shape or length and bind in
the same step:

```
match $args {
  []            { usage() }                # empty
  [cmd]         { run($cmd) }              # exactly one, bound as cmd
  [cmd ...rest] { run($cmd, ...$rest) }    # one-or-more; rest bound
}
```

So destructuring isn't *owned* by `match` — it is one list-pattern grammar, used
bare for the simple case and in a `match` arm when you need to branch.

**Regex captures.** The right-hand side is any list, and `:split` is not the only
way to build one — **`:match`** runs a regex against a string and hands back its
capture groups, so destructuring names them in one step. Like `~`, it is
**unanchored** — the first match anywhere in the string, so `[ip] =
$line:match(/\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+/)` pulls an address out of the middle of a line; anchor with
`^…$` when you mean the whole string:

```
[one two]      = $str:match(/(.*) (.*)/)          # two groups → two names
[year mon day] = $date:match(/(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)/)  # an ISO date into fields
[ip]           = $line:match(/\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+/) # no group → the whole match, one element
```

- **Positional groups** come back as a **list**, in order — the parenthesized
  sub-matches only, *not* the whole match — so `[one two] = …:match(/(.*) (.*)/)`
  binds exactly the two groups. A pattern with **no** group yields the whole match
  as a one-element list, so `[ip] = …:match(/re/)` still binds.
- **An unmatched group keeps its slot as `""`** — a group that didn't participate
  (an optional `(a)?(b)` against `"b"`) contributes an **empty string**, never a
  dropped position, so the list length equals the group count and the following
  bindings don't shift. mesh has no null, so `""` is the placeholder (a group that
  matched empty and one that didn't both read as `""` — distinguish with an
  explicit optional-group guard if you must).
- **Named groups** `(?<name>…)` come back as a **map** keyed by name
  (`m = $str:match(/(?<user>\w+)@(?<host>\S+)/)` then `$m.user`); an unmatched
  named group is present with value `""`. This pairs with map destructuring once
  that lands (deferred below). **Name all the groups or none** — a pattern that
  *mixes* named and unnamed groups is a **loud error** for the MVP (list or map is
  ambiguous); a later map-keyed-by-both-name-and-position rule is deferred until the
  need is real.
- **No match yields `false`**, not an empty collection. Matching is a pass/fail
  operation, so on a miss `:match` returns the bool **`false`** (status `1`) —
  keeping the model's rule that failure is signaled by a `false`, never by the
  *shape* of a value. On a match it returns the capture list (or map).
- **Test with `~`, capture with an `if`-binding.** A match returns a list/map, and
  a bare collection is *not* a condition (the [condition
  contract](#conditionals-if-is-an-expression) is a bool or a command, and a
  list has status `0` whether or not it matched). So use `~` for a pure yes/no, and
  put the assignment *in* the condition — the `if let` shape — to test **and**
  capture in one step, pattern written **once**, names in scope for the block:

  ```
  if $str ~ /(.*) (.*)/  { … }                          # yes/no only
  if [one two] = $str:match(/(.*) (.*)/)  { puts "$one / $two" }
  if m = $str:match(/(?<user>\w+)@(?<host>\S+)/)  { puts $m.user }
  ```

  As a *condition*, `lhs = rhs` is true iff the RHS is **truthy** (a `false` — the
  no-match, or `gets()` at EOF — fails it) **and** its shape fits `lhs`; on true the
  names bind for the block, on false it skips and binds nothing. A shape mismatch in
  the condition (`[a b]` against a three-element list) is a **soft false → skip** —
  deliberately unlike the bare statement below. This isn't regex-specific:
  `if line = gets() { … }` falls out of the same rule. The longer
  `match`-with-destructuring form is there when you want to branch on more than one
  shape:

  ```
  match $line:match(/(\w+): (.*)/) {
    [key val] { … }      # matched — key/val bound
    false     { … }      # no match
  }
  ```

- **A bare, unconditional bind is an assertion.** `[a b] = $str:match(/…/)` with
  no `if` says "I know this matches" — so a miss (`false`, not a two-element list)
  is a **loud error**, the [no-null](#variables-and-assignment) rule again: an
  unconditional bind that silently yielded `a = ""` would bury the bug. (The same
  mismatch *inside* an `if` condition is the quiet skip above — that contrast is the
  point of the `if let` form.) Reach for the `if` form when a miss is expected; the
  bare form when it isn't.

This makes `/re/` mesh's one regex story on the *value* side too: `~`
([Tests](#tests-and-comparisons)) answers yes/no, `:match` extracts the
captures — no `=~`-then-`$BASH_REMATCH` dance.

Named **`:match`** (not `:matches`), the unanchored scripting-world sense — Ruby
`String#match`, JS, Perl `=~`, bash `[[ =~ ]]`, grep — *not* Python's anchored
`re.match`. `:groups` / `:captures` were considered and dropped: `:match` pairs
with the [`match`](#matching-match) statement and the `~` test, one regex story
under one word.

*(**Decided — keep both, split by job** *(resolving the earlier "consolidate?"
open, settled alongside the [`match`](#matching-match) `~`-alignment law)*. They
overlap — `:match` is falsey on a miss, so `if $str:match(/re/)` covers `~`'s yes/no
— but the division is deliberate and worth two spellings: **`~` (and a bare `/re/`
`match` arm) answer *whether*; `:match` extracts *what*.** `~` reads as a bare
predicate and binds nothing; `:match` is the single capture path. Defining `~` as
literal sugar for `:match`-truthiness is a fine mental model and costs nothing, but
neither is dropped — a predicate that quietly returned a capture list, or a capture
call you had to read as a bool, would blur the whether/what line this keeps crisp.)*

**Regex is a first-class value** *(decided — porting `fromto`, `filter`, `he`,
`untar`)*. `/re/` is a **regex literal** evaluating to a regex **value**, and `~`
and `:match` **consume a regex value** — so `$str ~ /re/` and `$str:match(/re/)` are
the literal case. A `/…/` literal is **raw and does not interpolate** — like `r'…'`
but for a single lexical exception: **`\/` is the delimiter escape** (a literal slash
in the pattern, since `/` bounds the literal), and the lexer strips only that
backslash. Every *other* backslash reaches the regex engine verbatim (`\d`, `\.`,
`\\`), and `$` inside it is always the anchor; build a regex with a variable hole via
`re("…$var…")` (see the interpolation note below). A regex literal is recognized **only in the match slots** — the
`~`/`!~` RHS, the `:match` argument, the replace family's **first** (`OLD`) argument
(`:replaceall` / `:replacestart` / `:replaceend`), and a
`match` arm — and there a leading-slash
word is a regex **only when its base is a clean `/BODY/`** (the base is the word minus
any trailing `:` flag modifiers, so `/\d+/:i` qualifies; the closing `/` is the base's
final character and `BODY` has no unescaped interior `/`); every other leading-`/`
word is a **path or glob** (full rule and cases in [Quoting](#quoting-and-escaping)).
The `~` RHS *also* takes a **glob**: a **relative** one is bare (`*.txt`, `src/**`),
and an **absolute** one now also goes bare — `$p ~ /usr/*/bin`, `$p ~ /tmp/*` — with
`$p ~ /usr/bin` reading as the path. The one residual is a single segment with a
trailing slash: `$p ~ /tmp/` is the regex `tmp`; write `$p ~ /tmp` for the path (or
`fnmatch($p, "/tmp/")` / `== "/tmp/"`).
**Everywhere else a `/…/` word is a path or string** — `cd /tmp/`, `grep /usr/bin`,
`$env.PATH:has(/usr/bin)`, `p = /etc/hosts` are all unaffected (a `/…/` is a regex
only in the enumerated match slots above — including the `:match` and replace-family
(`:replaceall` / `:replacestart` / `:replaceend`) `OLD` argument slots — never in a
plain argument or any *other* modifier slot, so
`:has(/usr/bin)` stays a path). To
hold a regex as a **value** anywhere else — a variable, a list, another argument — or
to turn a pattern that arrives as a **string** (`fromto $from $to`, any `grep`-like)
into one, you use the constructor **`re($str)`**: `$line ~ re($to)`,
`$line:match(re($to))`. `re` is a
**[built-in](#built-ins)** (a rich value can't come from an external) and
**fail-loud** (a malformed pattern errors at the call, not silently), carries flags
on the value (`re($x, ignore-case: true)`), and `re($s, literal: true)` quotes the string to
match **verbatim** (Perl's `\Q…\E`) — the common "match exactly what the user typed"
case. A **bare string is never auto-converted** *(decided — no RHS coercion, for
now)*: `$s ~ "a.b"` is an **error** pointing at `re("a.b")` or `/a.b/`, so a string
full of metacharacters never silently becomes a pattern — the same no-silent-coercion
rule as `:int`.

*(Settled — regex flags are `:` modifiers* (independent of the quoting exploration
above). Flags are set with the ordinary
[`:` modifier](#modifiers) machinery rather than a constructor flag: `re($x):i` /
`:ignorecase`, `:m` / `:multiline`, `:s` / `:dotall`, `:x` / `:extended` —
chainable, and carrying the readable-or-terse dual spelling used elsewhere. This
applies to `re(…)` and to the `/…/` literal (`/\d+/:i`). *(Decided: the `:` modifiers
**coexist** with the `ignore-case:` constructor argument — both spellings are
supported.)* `literal:` stays a
**constructor** argument regardless, since it
changes how the string becomes a pattern rather than being a post-hoc flag on a
finished regex. Match-behavior flags (`:i` `:m` `:s`) work as post-hoc modifiers on
any regex value; a **parse-affecting** flag like `:x` cannot, because `re()` is
fail-loud and compiles the *unflagged* pattern first — `re('foo # (')` errors before
a trailing `:x` could make it valid in extended mode. Parse-affecting flags must
therefore be known at construction: folded in pre-compile on a `/…/` literal
(`/foo#(/:x`, compiled once; `#(` is ignored only in extended mode) or passed as a constructor argument
(`re($x, extended: true)`), never as a post-hoc modifier on a finished value.)*

*(decided: **`/…/` does not interpolate** — it is a **raw** regex literal (raw except
the `\/` delimiter escape; see the regex-value section above), so a `$` inside `/…/`
is always the anchor/metacharacter, with no splice-vs-anchor ambiguity. To build a regex with a variable hole, use
**`re("…$var…")`**: the `"…"` string does the interpolation (its settled `$`-splice /
`\$`-literal rules apply), then `re()` compiles. So there is **one** interpolation
path — the `"…"` string — and no `/$var/` special case; the earlier deferred sugar is
dropped.*

*An interpolated hole is **regex source** by default (metacharacters live — building a
pattern from parts is what `re()`-from-a-string means). To splice a value as a
**literal** (match it verbatim, the regex-injection-safe case), quote it with the
**`:quotemeta`** modifier — `re("^${user:quotemeta}@")` — Perl's `\Q…\E` / Python's
`re.escape` as an ordinary modifier. It is the per-value cousin of `re($s, literal: true)`
(which quotes a whole string); use `:quotemeta` when only the hole is literal and the
skeleton is a real pattern.)*

*(deferred: **map destructuring** — `[name: n, age: a] = $m` binding by key — a
natural extension of the same idea; and nested patterns (`[a [b c]] = …`).)*

### Functions

```
func greet(name) {
  echo "hi, $name"
}

greet world               # -> hi, world
```

Paren-delimited, `func name(params) { … }` — C/Go/JS muscle memory, and unlike
Elvish's `{|a b| … }` or Nushell's `def f [a b] { … }` it puts the signature
where a reader already looks for it. Parameters are **named**: inside the body
you reference `$name`, never `$1`. This is the fish `--argument-names` idea
promoted to the declaration itself.

The signature borrows Nushell's/Elvish's proven vocabulary — *positional*,
*optional-with-default*, *flag*, and *rest*:

```
func deploy(env, --region = us-west, --force, --tag = latest, ...hosts) {
  # $env     required positional
  # $region  valued flag,   defaults to us-west
  # $force   boolean switch: true iff --force was passed
  # $tag     valued flag,   defaults to latest
  # $hosts   list of any remaining positionals   (rest / "flattening")
}

deploy prod --force web1 web2
#   env=prod  region=us-west  force=true  tag=latest  hosts=[web1 web2]

deploy prod --region=eu-west --tag=v9 ...$fleet
#   env=prod  region=eu-west  tag=v9  hosts = the spread-in elements of $fleet
```

`region` is a **flag**, not an optional positional, on purpose — with a
`...hosts` rest parameter present, an optional *positional* `region` could not
be skipped (the first host would silently bind to it). That is the general
rule below. An optional positional is fine when it is the last non-rest
parameter and can just be omitted from the right:

```
func tag(image, version = latest) {          # optional positional, no rest
  docker tag $image $image:$version
}
tag app          # version defaults to latest
tag app v9       # version = v9
```

Rules:

- **Positionals** bind left to right. A parameter with `= default` is optional
  and may be **omitted only from the right** — you cannot skip an optional
  positional while still supplying a later positional or a rest element. When
  you need to set a later value but default an earlier one, make the earlier
  one a `--flag`; that skip-ability is the main reason to prefer a flag over an
  optional positional. It follows that an optional positional and a `...rest`
  do **not** usefully coexist (the rest would swallow anything meant for the
  optional), so a signature with `...rest` keeps its positionals required.
- **Flags** are declared with a leading `--`. `--force` (no `=`) is a boolean
  **switch**, false unless passed; `--tag = default` is a **valued flag**. At the call
  site each has the two equivalent spellings from
  [Calling for a value](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas): the dashed sugar
  (`--force`, `--tag=v2`) and the value-mode `key: value` pair (`force: true`,
  `tag: v2`) — `--force` ≡ `force: true`, `--tag=v2` ≡ `tag: v2`. A valued flag in
  dashed form is **attached only** (`--tag=v2`, never a separate `--tag v2` that
  consumes the next token), so every argument stays **self-contained** — which matters
  because a value-mode call's arguments are comma-separated. Neither a switch nor a
  valued flag ever swallows a following argument: `--force web1` is the switch `--force`
  plus a positional `web1`, and a bare `--tag` with **no `=value`** is a missing-value
  **error**, not a consume-the-next-token. (An **external** command still accepts the
  separate `--tag v2` getopt form — mesh does not parse its flags, it only passes the
  tokens through.)
  Flags may appear in any order at the call site and are *not* consumed as
  positionals — this is why a shell wants real flag parsing in the signature
  rather than hand-rolled `case $1` juggling. An argument that begins with `--`
  but names **no declared flag** is an **error**, not a silently-forwarded
  positional — a typo'd flag should fail loudly, not vanish into `...rest`.
  When a flag is given **more than once** (directly or via a spread), the
  **last occurrence wins** for a valued flag (`--tag=v1 --tag=v2` binds `v2`, the
  universal CLI convention that makes a forwarded default overridable), and a
  repeated switch is simply still true (idempotent) — neither repeat is an error.
  *(TODO — flag-grammar extensions the settled `--long` grammar doesn't yet cover,
  surfaced porting `recent`/`shift_options`/`homepkg`/`setup`:*
  - ***Short & numeric flags.*** Interactive use leans on `-N` counts (`recent -20`,
    the `head -20` idiom), single-letter switches (`-v`), bundles (`-abc`), and
    attached values (`-ffile`). Decide whether a function can declare short aliases
    (`--verbose | -v`) and a numeric-count form, or whether short/numeric flags stay
    an external-tool-only convention and in-shell functions are `--long`-only.
  - ***Enum / choice-constrained values.*** `homepkg --backend=mamba|conda|github`
    has no parse-time validation — "enum" exists only as a *completion* value type.
    Let a flag or positional declare an allowed-value set that validates at the call
    and feeds completion.
  - ***Mutually-exclusive switch groups.*** `setup`'s `--kde`/`--hypr`/`--sway` are
    three separate switches where at most one is allowed — a *different* requirement
    from a single enum value (a plain allowed-set check would still pass
    `setup --kde --sway`). Either steer such interfaces toward one enum-valued option
    (`--desktop=kde|hypr|sway`) or grow a mutex-group constraint in the signature.
  - ***Negatable / tri-state flags.*** `setup`'s `--gui`/`--no-gui` auto/yes/no
    pairs have no expression: a switch is binary, false-unless-passed, with no
    `--no-` negation. Allow a switch to auto-derive a `--no-` form (a
    enum-valued `auto`/`yes`/`no` binding), or a first-class three-valued flag.
    The omitted case must bind `auto`; it cannot be represented by an unbound or
    unset value because mesh has no absent value and omitted switches are bound.
  The `--`-mid-stream that `shift_options` relies on is already covered by the
  terminator rule below.)*
- **`--` ends flag parsing** (the universal Unix terminator, kept). Everything
  after a bare `--` is positional/rest, even if it begins with `--`. This is
  how a value that literally looks like a flag reaches a rest parameter:

  ```
  run --verbose -- --force ./x    # --verbose is run's flag;
                                  # ["--force" "./x"] are positionals -> ...rest
  wrap -- ...$argv                # forward argv verbatim, flags and all
  ```

  A single `--` element produced by a spread (`...$argv` where `$argv` contains
  `--`) terminates parsing the same way; to pass a *literal* `--` as data,
  place it after an earlier `--`.
- **Rest** (`...name`, at most one, last) collects the leftover positionals
  into a list. This is the "flattening" you asked about — the same slurpy/`@rest`
  concept as Raku's `*@rest`, Elvish's `@rest`, Nushell's `...rest`, Tcl's
  `args`.
- **Arguments do not word-split.** A bare list argument passes to an **in-shell
  function** as one list value. External programs take **bytes only**, so an
  un-spread list handed to an external command is an **error** — spread it
  (`...$xs`, one argv entry per element) or join it (`$xs:join(",")`, one
  string). The shell never guesses a serialization (see
  [Spread](#spread--flattening)).
- **Result and `return`.** A function's **result is its last expression** —
  evaluated like any block, the same rule as [`if`](#conditionals-if-is-an-expression).
  No explicit `return` is needed to produce it. `return` on its own exits the
  function **early**, carrying the result so far; `return val` exits early
  **with a value**. That is the whole return mechanism — implicit last
  expression, `return`/`return val` for early exit. A function with **no
  expression to yield** — an empty body, or a bare `return` before anything
  ran — results in the **empty string with status `0`**, the same "nothing
  produced, nothing failed" answer a no-`else` `if` gives; there is no null to
  invent.
- **Exit status is a view of the result** — not a separate channel — and it is
  defined for *every* result type, so a function used in command position
  (`if f { … }`) always has one:

  | Result type | Exit status |
  | --- | --- |
  | command | its own exit status |
  | int | the integer itself — `0` success (the shell `return N`) |
  | bool | `true` → `0`, `false` → `1` (the Unix inversion) |
  | string / list / map / styled value / Instant / Duration / regex / stream handle (incl. empty or zero) | `0` — producing a value *is* success |

  So `have_command` ends in a test whose bool becomes the status and
  `if have_command fzf { … }` reads correctly; `return $cond` exits `0`/`1`;
  `return 2` exits `2`; and a function that returns a string or a list is a
  success (`0`) when its status is observed. Failure is only ever signaled by a
  command's own status, a `false`, or an explicit nonzero `int` — never by the
  mere *shape* of a returned value.

  A status is the OS's **8-bit** process status, so an out-of-range int is
  **masked to `0`–`255`** (`return 256` → `0`, `return -1` → `255`, matching
  `exit`) — an in-process call and a process-backed one then report the *same*
  status. The full integer survives as the function's **value** (`n = f()`);
  only the *status view* is 8-bit.
- **Output is stdout.** Independently of its result, whatever a `func` writes to
  stdout *is* its output stream, exactly like an external command, so functions
  compose in byte-stream pipes with everything else.

  **Value vs stream — resolved** (see [Calling for a value, and
  lambdas](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas)). `return val` / last-expression
  settle how a function *produces* a value; the caller chooses which channel it
  reads **by syntax**: `f(arg)` (parens attached) takes the **return value**,
  `$(f arg)` takes the **stdout bytes**, bare `f arg` runs it. No declaration
  modifier and no context magic — the parens are forced anyway, since a bare RHS
  word is a literal string.

**Prior art surveyed** (all shell-adjacent, all validate the same four
signature roles): Elvish `{|a b &opt=default @rest|}`, Nushell
`def f [a, b?, --sw, --n = d, ...rest]`, fish `function f --argument-names …`,
Raku signatures (`$x = 5`, `*@rest`), Tcl `proc` (`{b 5}`, `args`),
PowerShell `param()` with `[Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments)]`. mesh
takes the *semantics* these agree on and dresses them in the `func name(...)`
syntax above.

*(TODO: **wrappers, forwarding, and dynamic definition.** [No aliases](#built-ins)
is *decided* — a `func` replaces `alias ll`. But real configs still need things a
plain `func` doesn't yet give cleanly; these are open:*
  - *A **terse forwarding wrapper.** Even `func co(...args) { vcs checkout ...$args }`
    is not a fully transparent baseline: under the settled function rules an
    **undeclared long flag** (`co --amend`) is rejected before `...args` can collect
    it, so the caller would need an explicit `--` — the same trap nushell hits, where
    a plain `def` wrapper rejects `co -m msg` as an "unknown flag" unless it uses
    `def --wrapped`. So the open work is a shorthand — `wrap co = vcs checkout`, or a
    loop-friendly definer over `$(vcs --list-commands)` — that **disables the
    wrapper's own flag parsing and forwards every argument verbatim**, which a plain
    `...args` `func` does not do today. *Decided (porting the ssh/vcs wrappers): a
    wrapper **cannot** validate the flags it forwards — it does not know the callee's
    grammar — so a passthrough wrapper forwards unknown flags **verbatim** and
    validity is enforced at the **wrapped call**: the wrapped in-shell `func`'s own
    signature rejects a bad flag (a loud error* there*), or the external program
    rejects it itself. Disabling the wrapper's flag parsing therefore does not drop
    the check, it **relocates** it to where the grammar is known. Still open: only the
    surface — `wrap`, a `--wrapped` marker, or a passthrough-tagged `...rest`.*
  - ***Running a wrapper under `sudo` / `xargs` / `watch`.** Because mesh commands
    are functions, not aliases or `PATH` binaries, `sudo ll` can't see `ll` — bash
    papers over this with the invisible `alias sudo='sudo '` trailing-space trick.
    mesh should offer a deliberate way to say "expand this command's first argument
    as a mesh command" instead.*
  - *Whether to expose **dynamic definition** (a function whose name is computed —
    the `set_up_ssh_aliases` `eval` loop) at all; a dynamically-defined function
    still [completes](#completion) like any other once it exists, so the cost is
    **readability and static analysis** (you can't tell from reading the config
    which commands are defined), not completion. The wrapper shorthand may cover
    the real need; if a general escape hatch is wanted, prefer a **scoped**
    primitive over bash's
    string-concatenating `eval`. Leaning: a forwarding-wrapper shorthand with
    transparent flag passthrough, defer general dynamic definition.)*

### Isolation and subshells

**A plain `func` does not isolate process state.** cwd, umask, and the `env`
map are OS process state, not mesh values, so a `func` runs *in the current
process* and its `cd` (or `export`) **persists after return** — exactly like
bash, and exactly what navigation helpers want:

```
func proj(name) { cd ~/work/$name }     # moving your shell is the point
```

The decisive reason to keep persist as the default (over auto-restoring cwd the
way local-by-default does for variables): **it keeps the *process-state*
boundary refactor-safe.** Lift a run of lines out of a function body into a
helper `func` and the `cd`/`export`/umask effects behave identically at the new
call edge — an auto-restoring boundary would silently restore cwd there instead.
(This is only about process state; extracting lines that read a caller-*local*
variable would still break under lexical scope — that is exactly what the
dynamic-scope TODO below is about — and moving a `return`/`break` retargets it,
as in any language.) Isolation is therefore **explicit**, in three grades:

```
fork { cd build; make }                 # subshell: forks; cwd/env/umask/vars
                                        #   isolated, nonzero exit can't kill
                                        #   the outer shell
fork func build() { cd build; make }    # a func whose *body* is a subshell — the
                                        #   `fork` prefix (vs a plain `func`) is the
                                        #   isolation flag
in dist { rm -rf * }                    # scoped cwd: run the block there, restore
                                        #   after — NO fork (cheaper than subshell)
```

A **subshell forks**, so — like `export` — only **bytes** cross back out (its
stdout); rich list/map values do not survive the process boundary. `in DIR { }`
does not fork: it is the lightweight "do this over there without stranding me,"
covering the common `pushd`/`popd` pattern with a block.

*(open, deferred cluster: whether a `func` defined inside a `func` is visible
only there. Also a **TODO — dynamic scope**: the same "extract a chunk into a
subfunction" goal that motivates persist would be served further for *variables*
by letting an extracted helper see the caller's locals; worth weighing dynamic —
or opt-in dynamic — scope against the lexical default decided above.)*

### Calling for a value, and lambdas

A `func` has two outputs — the **bytes** it writes to stdout (composes in pipes,
like any command) and the **value** it returns (last expression / `return val`,
a rich list/map/scalar). Which you get is chosen by **how you write the call**,
and that choice is really a choice of **mode**:

| Mode | Form | You get | Idiomatic args |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **command** — run it | `f arg --flag` (bare), or `$(f arg)` | stdout streams (status is the result); `$(…)` captures the bytes | **space**-separated positionals, `--flag` / `--flag=value` |
| **value** — call for its return | `f(arg, key: value)` (parens attached) | the mesh value | **comma**-separated positionals, `key: value` options |

The split is by **mode, not callee**. A function *run* in command position looks
like a command on purpose — that is how you use it at the prompt (`co main --amend`,
bare, no ceremony) — and the *same* function *called for a value* looks like a
function (`x = co(main, amend: true)`). Command position is unchanged from any shell;
the comma grammar appears **only** inside `f(...)`, so the prompt stays all spaces and
commas live in expressions. (The `f(...)` marker is required at all because a bare word
on an assignment RHS is already a [literal string](#variables-and-assignment) —
`x = greet` binds `"greet"`, so reaching a function's value needs the parens.)

**Options have two equivalent spellings, one idiomatic per mode.** The `--force` you
type at the prompt and the `force: true` you write in a value call are the *same
option*:

- **Value mode — `key: value`**, the [map literal](#maps-associative-arrays) shape, so a
  call's options *are* a little map — and one can be **spread**: `deploy(prod, ...$opts)`
  where `opts = [region: us-west, force: true]`. Values compose (`port: $base + 1`).
- **Command mode / dashed sugar — `--flag` / `--flag=value`**, with a bare `--flag` ≡
  `flag: true` (`--region=us-west` ≡ `region: us-west`; `--force` ≡ `force: true`). An
  explicit **false** is the `force: false` pair; there is no `--no-flag` negation sugar
  (whether a switch auto-derives one is left open under [Functions](#functions)).
- The two are **interchangeable** — you *may* write `--flag` inside `f(...)`, it is just
  clumsier than the `key: value` it equals; and `key: value` is **value-mode only** (a
  bare `key: value` in space-separated command position tokenizes awkwardly, and maps
  need `[...]` anyway).
- A bare `key=value` (no colon, no `--`) stays a **literal string** positional — that is
  the `env FOO=1` / `make CC=gcc` / `git commit --author=me` case — so `=` is never an
  option separator on its own; it only appears attached to a `--flag`.

```
config = load-env($path)                     # value call, one arg
n      = add($a, $b)                         # positionals comma-separated
deploy(prod, region: us-west, force: true)   # value mode: key: value options
deploy prod --region=us-west --force         # command mode: the same options as --flags
deploy(prod, ...$opts)                       # opts = [region: us-west, force: true]
config = load-config()                       # zero args still needs () — a bare name is a string
```

Rules:

- **Positionals are positional-only** — passed by position, never by name
  (`cp(a, b)`, not `cp(dest: b, src: a)`), exactly like a shell command's
  positional arguments. A parameter's *name* is therefore never part of the
  positional call surface, so `f(help)` is unambiguously the string `"help"` in
  first position, and a `--help` **option** is told apart by its leading `--` — the
  same way a shell already separates flags from arguments.
- **A signature declares options with the `--name` spelling**
  (`func deploy(env, --force, --region = us-west, --out = -) { … }`) and positionals as
  bare names (`env`); either call spelling (`--region=us-west` or `region: us-west`)
  binds the same parameter. `...spread` works in both modes — a list of positionals or
  a map of options.
- **The channels are independent.** During `x = f(…)`, whatever `f` writes to
  stdout still goes wherever stdout goes — the value call reads the *return*
  value, it does not capture or suppress output. A well-behaved value function
  simply does not print; one that legitimately does both streams *and* returns.
- **Both channels at once — `:capture`.** When you genuinely need more than one,
  `f(…):capture` runs the call and returns a **record of every channel**: `.value`
  (the return value), `.out` and `.err` (its stdout / stderr, as **raw byte-strings**
  — split them with the usual [`:lines`](#modifiers) / `:split` / `:nulls` modifiers
  as needed, so the record bakes in no split policy), and `.status` (the exit **int**;
  *TODO — a richer status value if one is wanted later*). Read them with ordinary field
  access — `r = f(x):capture` binds `r`, then `$r.value` / `$r.out:lines` read it. It is an
  *invocation-level* modifier, not a plain value [modifier](#modifiers) — it has to
  wrap execution, since by the time a value modifier saw the return value the stdout
  would already have streamed away, the same reason `$(…)` is a wrapper rather than a
  postfix. The **same `cmd(…):capture` spelling works on an external** — and is the
  single exception to the value-call error below: a bare `grep(foo)` errors because it
  asks for a return value the command lacks, but `grep(foo):capture` asks for the
  channel record, so it is allowed and comes back the same **minus `.value`** (there
  is none — accessing it is a loud no-such-field error). External captures accept
  positional arguments only. A direct `key: value`, a
  dashed option interpreted through a mesh signature, or a map spread is an error
  because an external has no signature or canonical named-option encoding; pass
  the intended argv tokens as positionals instead (for example, `"--color=never"`).
  Reaching for `:capture` is
  the sign a function is doing two jobs at once; a single-channel function needs none
  of it. *(TODO — further fields such as timing and a `pipestatus` list; today it is
  the four above.)*
- **Externals have no return value**, so a bare `grep(foo)` is a **runtime error**
  that points you at `$(grep foo)` for stdout, or `grep(foo):capture` for the full
  channel record. Rich values stay in-shell — the same bytes-only boundary as
  `export` and subshells. (`f` resolves at call time, so this is a runtime, not parse,
  distinction.)

**Lambdas** are then just anonymous functions — the `func` declaration minus the
name, reusing its whole signature grammar (defaults, `--flags`, `...rest`) — and
they are value-called the same way:

```
double = func(x) { $x * 2 }       # a function value bound to a variable
y = $double(5)                    # value-call it through the variable

evens = $xs:filter(func(x) { $x % 2 == 0 })
stems = $files:map(func(f) { $f:stem })    # :map / :filter / :each take a lambda
```

`func(params) { … }` (over an Elvish-style `{|params| …}`) keeps **one parameter
syntax** for named and anonymous functions, and the transform modifiers
(`:map` / `:filter` / `:each` / `:sort …`) are where lambdas earn their keep,
complementing the auto-mapping value modifiers for the cases a bare modifier
can't express.

A **bare modifier reference is itself a callable value**, so where a predicate or
mapper is wanted you can hand a modifier directly instead of wrapping it in a
lambda: `$files:filter(:exec)` *is* `$files:filter(func(f) { $f:exec })`, and
`$paths:map(:stem)` *is* `$paths:map(func(p) { $p:stem })`. A `:mod` in argument
position denotes "the function that applies `:mod`"; the lambda form remains for
anything a single modifier can't say.

### Conditionals: `if` is an expression

`if` **yields a value** — it is an expression, not just a statement (Rust,
Kotlin, Nix). So the same construct that branches control flow also *produces*
the branch's value, which is what lets a value-returning function (the
[structured-return TODO](#functions) above) have a natural body and kills a
whole category of `x = $(if … )` scaffolding.

```
# statement position — run a branch for effect
if have_command fzf {
  bind-key ctrl-r fzf-history
} else if have_command atuin {
  atuin init mesh | source
}

# expression position — the taken branch's value becomes the result
glyph = if connected_remotely { "⇄" } else { "•" }
tag   = if $root { "[root]" } else { "" }
```

Decisions:

- **The condition is a bool or a command.** A boolean value (`$root`, a
  comparison like `$n > 0`, a `:has` test) branches on its truth; a bare
  command branches on its **exit status** (`0` → true), preserving the
  `if grep -q foo file { … }` reflex. This is why the [predicate
  vocabulary](#requirements-carried-over-from-existing-configs)
  (`have_command`, `inside_project`, …) is just commands/functions — they slot
  straight into `if` with no `[ … ]` / `test`.
- **An assignment may *be* the condition** — `if lhs = rhs { … }`, the `if let`
  shape. The condition is true iff the RHS is **truthy** (a `false` / failed
  command / nonzero int fails it) **and** its shape **fits** `lhs`; on true the
  names bind for the block, on false it skips and binds nothing. `lhs` may be a
  name (always fits) or a `[…]` [destructuring](#destructuring) pattern, so
  `if [one two] = $s:match(/…/) { … }` and `if line = gets() { … }` both test-and-bind
  in one step, RHS written once. Crucially, **pattern-fit is part of the test**: a
  shape or length mismatch (`[a b]` against a three-element list) makes the
  condition *false and skips* — it does **not** error. That is the deliberate
  contrast with a bare `lhs = rhs` statement, where the same mismatch is a loud
  assertion failure — the conditional form is "bind if it fits," the statement form
  is "it must fit."
- **No `then` / `fi`.** Brace-delimited blocks, same as `func` bodies; chain
  with `else if`. The POSIX `then`/`elif`/`fi` scaffolding is dropped (clean
  break).
- **The value is the taken branch's trailing expression.** A block evaluates to
  its last expression — a bare value, a `[…]` literal, a `$(…)` capture, a
  value-function call, or a nested `if`. In *statement* position that value is
  simply discarded and any commands in the branch stream to stdout exactly as
  today; the expression behavior is a superset, not a mode switch.
- **A missing `else` yields the empty string.** In expression position, a false
  condition with no `else` produces **`""`** — one concrete value, not a
  context-dependent "empty string or empty list." mesh infers types and does not
  carry a contextual target type back into the branch, so there is nothing to
  pick an empty *list* from; the empty string is the universal shell "nothing"
  that a prompt fragment wants — `tag = if $root { "[root]" }` then `"$tag…"`
  reads a plain empty string when not root (interpolate the *bound value*, not a
  `$(…)` stdout capture, which a statement-position `if` would not feed).
  Both branches (when both exist) are expected to yield the same *shape*; mesh
  does not coerce one to match the other. **Decided: lenient** — a lone `if` is
  a valid expression and the no-`else` case is `""`. (The stricter Rust-style
  alternative — *require* `else` in expression position, lone `if` as statement
  only — was considered and dropped: it buys parse-time "you forgot the else"
  safety but costs the terse `tag = if $root { "[root]" }` one-liner, and
  interactive brevity wins here.)
- **`match`** is the multi-way companion — its own section below.

**Postfix guard.** A single statement may carry a trailing `if` (or `unless`)
guard — the Ruby/Perl statement modifier — for the very common one-line skip:

```
continue if $f ~ *.tmp
release $tag if $tag ~ /^v[0-9]+/
return unless $args:len > 0
```

This is the shortest guarded form. It is deliberately limited to a **single
statement** — no `else`, no block — so the block `if cond { … }` stays the form
for anything larger; the two do not overlap (guard for one-liners, block for
bodies). It pairs naturally with `~` (`continue if $f ~ *.tmp`) and the file-test
modifiers (`skip $p unless $p:exists`).

The deep seam — what a branch's value *is* when its tail is a byte-streaming
external command rather than a mesh value — is the same bytes-vs-values
question as the structured-return TODO, and is tracked there rather than
re-litigated here.

### Matching: `match`

`match` is a pattern-matching switch and, like `if`, an **expression** — it
tests a value against patterns top to bottom, runs the first arm that matches,
and yields that arm's value. It **replaces bash `case`** with less ceremony (no
`in` / `)` / `;;` / `esac`) and it returns a value:

```
kind = match $file {
  *.md | *.markdown   { markdown }     # glob patterns, alternation with `|`
  *.txt               { text }
  /^README/           { readme }       # a /regex/ arm (slash-delimited)
  .git                { special }      # a literal
  _                   { other }        # `_` is the default (the old `*)` )
}
```

Arm patterns, in one vocabulary:

| Pattern | Matches | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `foo`, `42` | a literal value | exact |
| `*.txt`, `foo*` | a **glob** | fnmatch — the string metacharacters of [Globbing](#globbing) (`* ? [] {} **`); the filesystem qualifiers (`(f)`, `size`, `age`) are expansion-only |
| `/re/` | a **regex** | slash-delimited; this is mesh's whole regex story (no separate `=~`) |
| `a \| b` | either | alternation |
| `1..=9` | a **range** | the `..` / `..=` from slices |
| `_` | anything | the default; put it last |

Rules:

- **First match wins**, top to bottom; `_` is the catch-all and conventionally
  last. Whether non-`_`-exhaustive matches must be total is *(open)* — leaning
  lenient (a `match` with no arm hit yields `""`, like a no-`else` `if`).
- **It is an expression**: `x = match … { … }` binds the winning arm's value;
  in statement position the value is discarded and arms run for effect.
- **Regex captures**: on the *value* side this is **settled** — `str:match(/re/)`
  returns the groups (positional → list, named → map); see
  [Destructuring](#destructuring). A `/re/` **arm** does **not** *auto*-bind its
  groups *(decided — resolving the earlier open)*: a bare `/re/` arm is a pure
  yes/no predicate exactly like the `~` it mirrors (see the `~`/`match` note below),
  and to *capture* you go through `:match` explicitly — an `if`-binding
  `if [a b] = $x:match(/re/) { … }`, or a match over the capture result,
  `match $x:match(/re/) { [a b] { … } false { … } }` (a bare `[a b] = …` is *not*
  itself an arm — an arm is a pattern with an optional guard and then a block).
  Auto-binding would smuggle invisible, position-fragile names into the arm body
  (Perl's `$1` / bash's `BASH_REMATCH`), the one implicit-value habit mesh's error
  model exists to refuse; keeping capture explicit leaves a single obvious rule and a
  clean split — `~`/`/re/`-arm answer *whether*, `:match` extracts *what*.
- **List-shape patterns** *(settled — see [Destructuring](#destructuring))*: a
  `match` arm may be a list pattern that **binds by position** — a bare element is
  always a **binder** (never a literal to match), with `_` to discard and `...rest`
  for the tail (`[a b]`, `[cmd ...rest]`). Note this differs from a *top-level* arm,
  where a bare word is a literal: inside `[ ]` you are destructuring, so `[start arg]`
  binds both. To *match* a specific element, use an arm **guard**
  (`[verb ...rest] if $verb == "quit"`). Richer element sub-patterns (a literal /
  glob / `/re/` element, or nesting) and **map-shape** patterns (`[k: v]`) stay
  **deferred** until the need is real.

**`~` and `match` share one pattern vocabulary, but `~` is a strict subset** *(current
M3 behavior)*. For a **string** subject and a **glob or regex** pattern,
`match $x { P { … } }` takes the `P` arm iff `$x ~ P` — that shared core is learned
once. But an arm does strictly more than a `~` RHS:

| Pattern | `match` arm | `~` RHS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| glob `*.txt`, regex `/re/` (string subject) | ✔ | ✔ |
| literal on any type (`match 7 { 7 { … } }`) | ✔ (`==`) | ✗ — `~` needs a **string** left operand |
| range `1..=9` | ✔ | ✗ |
| alternation `a \| b` | ✔ | ✗ — `~`'s RHS is one glob/regex value |
| list-binding `[a b]`, `[cmd ...rest]` | ✔ | ✗ — `~` is a bool, binds nothing |

So `~` is the scalar, string-only slice of the arm grammar; `match` adds literal-on-any-
type, ranges, alternation, and destructuring.

**How an arm body yields a value** *(current M3 behavior)*. An arm body is a **block**,
the same `{ … }` as an `if` branch. Whether it produces a value depends on position,
exactly like `if`:

- **Statement position** — `match $x { … }` on its own line — runs the arm as an
  ordinary block: commands execute and stream, *no* value, *no* capture. `*.x { ls }`
  runs `ls`.
- **Expression position** — `y = match $x { … }`, or nested in another value expression
  — resolves the body to a value by its tail (`eval_value_body`): (1) a
  **value-expression tail** (`{ "text" }`, `{ $v }`, `{ [a b] }`, nested `if`/`match`)
  yields that value; (2) a body that is a **single bare word** (`{ markdown }`) is read
  as a **scalar literal** — usually the string `"markdown"`, but a numeric or boolean
  spelling types accordingly (`{ 7 }` is integer `7`, `{ false }` is boolean `false`),
  and only when that word is the whole body (`{ puts x; text }` runs `text`); (3) a body
  ending in a **command** (`{ wc -l < $f }`) runs the **whole
  body** and yields its captured stdout **only on exit 0** — note this captures *every*
  statement's stdout, not just the tail's, so `{ puts a; some-cmd }` includes the `a`
  (nonzero aborts; a bare `$(…)` shares the exit-0 gate). To return a string reliably
  today, quote it: `{ "text" }`.
  *(A function's value-return is **not** yet an expression context — a `match` as a
  function's last statement runs in statement position and the value is discarded;
  structured value-return / value-calls beyond `re(…)` are unbuilt.)*

**Design levers under consideration** *(open — none decided this pass)*. The exploration
narrowed the question to four choices; current leanings noted, but all four are open:

1. **Shape** — prefix `match $x { … }` (Rust / nushell, and consistent with mesh's own
   prefix `if`/`for`/`while`) vs **subject-first** `$x match { … }` (Scala; aligns with
   the infix, subject-first `~` and `:mod`) vs `case $x { … }`. *Lean: prefix* — `if` is
   mesh's own precedent for an expression-that-branches, and it is prefix; the
   `~`/`match` "asymmetry" then just reflects operator-vs-keyword, as with `==` vs `if`.
2. **Keyword** — `match` vs `case`. `case`/`when` is a genuine value-returning expression
   in Ruby, so `case` is viable. *Lean: `match`* — mesh's arms are *patterns* (Ruby
   spells those `case`/**`in`**), the cross-language pattern keyword is `match`
   (Rust/Scala/nushell), reusing shell `case` with `{ }` braces is false familiarity
   (no `in`/`;;`/`esac`), and `match` pairs with `~`. `switch` (statement-flavored) and
   `~~` (Perl **smartmatch** — deprecated for its type-dispatched unpredictability) are
   declined.
3. **`~` scope** — keep it narrow (string vs glob/regex) or widen it toward the arm
   grammar. *Lean: narrow*, revisiting only **alternation** on the RHS (`$f ~ *.a|*.b`)
   as the extension that pays for itself. Full type-dispatch parity (Ruby's `===`) is
   rejected — it re-creates the smartmatch trap.
4. **Arm-body value model** — keep today's tail-coercion (rules above), or move to
   **block + tail-expression, no coercion** (a bare word is always a command, capture is
   always explicit `$(…)`), or a Rust-style **`=> expr`** arm. *Lean: block +
   tail-expression* — it matches what `if` already claims ("a block evaluates to its last
   expression"), deletes the bare-word/exit-0 sharp edges, and is a language-wide
   tightening (applies to `if` too), not a `match`-only change. `=>` reads well but forks
   `match` from mesh's `{ }`-block control flow.

**Proposal (not settled) — an explicit value-keyword model** *(open; **conflicts with**
the settled function/`if` contract, which it does **not** replace)*. This records a
direction from the exploration. It **reverses** parts of the currently-settled design
and is on the table as an alternative, **not** a decision:

- The **settled** contract *(unchanged, and still in force)*: a function's/block's value
  is its **last expression** — no keyword needed ([Functions](#functions),
  [Conditionals](#conditionals-if-is-an-expression)); `return`/`return val` is
  **early-exit only**; **status is a view of the result** (int→itself, bool→`0`/`1`,
  any other value→`0`); the caller picks value-vs-stream **by syntax** (`f()` value,
  `$(f)` stdout, bare `f` runs); and a **bare RHS word is a literal string**.
- The **proposal**: make `puts`/printing the only explicit way to write a **typed value
  to stdout** as bytes (ordinary command stdout — `ls`, external programs — still streams
  bytes for pipes and `$(f)` capture; and the settled value-rendering boundary still
  converts a typed value to bytes when it is **interpolated or passed as external argv**,
  e.g. `external $n` — both unchanged) and require an
  **explicit keyword** for a typed value, so `{ … }` blocks are pure command-context (a
  bare word always *runs*; quotes mean only "group into one word," removing the
  `"$a""$b"` value-vs-command ambiguity at a block tail). This **reopens** the settled
  "value is the last expression" rule and the "bare RHS word is a literal string" rule —
  reconciling the two is itself the open question.

If the proposal is taken, the remaining sub-choice is *which keyword(s)* and how they
coexist with the settled `return` / `return val`:

- **Option 1 — two keywords, split by scope: `yield` (local) + `return` (function).**
  `yield <value>` produces the value of the **nearest value-yielding block** — an `if`
  branch, a `match` arm, a bare `{ }` in expression position — *without* leaving the
  function; `return <value>` produces the **enclosing function's** value and exits it
  early. Rationale: local-yield and function-return are genuinely different — a `match`
  arm inside a function must yield *the arm's* value while the function keeps running
  (`yield`), which is not the same as bailing out of the whole function (`return`);
  mirrors generators. `return`'s status is unchanged — the settled view of the result.
  Cost / sub-questions: two keywords; must define a function body's value (trailing
  `yield`? explicit `return`? last `yield` wins?); and whether `yield` outside a value
  context is an error.
- **Option 2 — one keyword, no separate local yield: `return <value>`.**
  `return <value>` is the only value keyword; **status stays the settled view of the
  result** — an int's status is the int itself (so `return 5` yields the typed value `5`,
  read via `f()`, whose status *view* remains `5`), a bool's is `0`/`1`, any other value's
  is `0`. There is no separate value-plus-status channel: the result is one thing and its
  status is a view of it. (This is essentially the settled `return val` already; the only
  genuinely *new* part, shared with Option 1, is requiring the keyword in place of an
  implicit last expression.) Cost / sub-questions: gives **functions** a value but not
  `match` arms a *local* yield distinct from function-return, so `if`/`match`-as-expression
  still needs a mechanism — either the same `return` (restricting arm-values to
  function-tail position) or a separate local form (which collapses back toward Option 1).

The axis underneath both: do we need a *local* value-yield (for `if`/`match` arms)
distinct from a *function* return? Option 1 says yes (two keywords); Option 2 says no at
the function level and leaves arm-yield to be settled separately. Note the settled
design already resolves the status side of this — `return val` carries a value and
[status is a *view* of the result](#functions) (`return 5` → value `5`, status `5`) —
so Option 2 is close to what is *already* settled; the genuinely new (and conflicting)
part of the proposal is only **requiring an explicit keyword** in place of the settled
implicit last-expression rule.

**Proposal (not settled) — decouple a function's value from its status (StatusOr-style)**
*(open; **reopens** the settled [error model](#error-handling), specifically "status is a
view of the result")*.

- **The wart it addresses.** Under the settled rule that a function's status is a *view*
  of its result (int→itself, bool→`0`/`1`, any other value→`0`), a bare `int` return is
  really an **exit code, not data**: `return 5` reads as "failure, code 5," and `0` is
  **truthy** (success) while every other type's zero/empty is falsy — so an int's
  truthiness is *inverted* relative to a string's, because `int` is doing double duty as
  both data and error-code. The irreducible root: `0` means "success" as a **status** but
  "zero/empty" as **data** — opposite truthiness — and one `int` type cannot be both.
- **The proposal.** Separate them: a function's **value** is data (an `int` is just a
  number, `0` falsy like everywhere else) and its **failure** is a distinct channel,
  signaled **explicitly** (a `false`, or an error/status) — **never** by "nonzero int."
  The caller must confront failure to reach the value (StatusOr / Rust `Result` / Go
  `(v, err)`).
- **Ergonomics — the unpack is the `if let`, not manual two-value handling.** mesh
  already has the machinery, so this need not cost Go's `if err != nil` boilerplate:
  - `v = f()` (bare bind) **asserts success** — fail-loud if `f` failed (the strict
    bind), so a failed result can't be used silently;
  - `if v = f() { use $v } else { handle failure }` — the **`if let`**: binds the value on
    success, **branches on status**, handles failure in `else` (Rust's `if let Ok(v)`);
  - `r = f():capture` — the explicit full form: the settled
    [`:capture`](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas) returns a **record** (`$r.value`,
    `$r.out` / `$r.err`, `$r.status`), so the value and the failure channel are both in
    hand at once — the settled machinery already provides the "value + status together"
    the proposal wants.
- **Condition rule (value-vs-status resolved by syntax).** A call's role in a condition is
  set by its form, so "is a call its value or its status" is never ambiguous: bare `f` in
  a condition tests **status** (the command form); `f()` / `if v = f()` produce the
  **value**, and the `if let` branches on **success**, binding the value. Crucially the
  `if let` branches on **status, not the value's data-truthiness** — which is what lets
  `return 0` be honest data: `if n = count() { … }` takes the then-branch and binds
  `n = 0` because `f` *succeeded*; `0`'s own falsiness never enters in.
- **What it reopens / costs.** This reverses the settled "status is a view of the result"
  and the "nonzero int = failure" convention — load-bearing parts of the
  [error model](#error-handling). It also implies a **split**: `if external_cmd { }` still
  branches on the process exit status (an external command has no typed value), while
  `if my_func { }` / `if v = f()` branch on a mesh function's explicit success — two rules
  for `if` depending on the callee. Whether that split is coherent or confusing is the
  open question. *(This reverses an earlier lean in this exploration that "status is a view
  of the result" was fine; the int-as-data overload is what changed it.)*

### Tests and comparisons

This is the surface that replaces bash `[[ … ]]` — the pieces a condition needs,
each a plain value expression (usable in `if`, `while`, `match` guards, or bound
to a bool):

- **Compare** with `==` `!=` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`. Comparison is **type-directed**:
  on ints it is numeric, on strings lexical — so mesh needs no `-lt`-vs-`<`
  split (`$n > 5` numeric, `$a < $b` lexical, decided by the operands' types).
- **Pattern-match** with `~` / `!~`: `$f ~ *.txt` is a bool "does the string
  match this glob," and `$f ~ /re/` the regex form — the one-line boolean twin
  of a `match` arm (`!~` negates). This is bash's `[[ $f == *.glob ]]` and
  `[[ $s =~ re ]]`, unified. The regex form is **unanchored** (first match
  anywhere, as bash `=~` and grep are); anchor with `^…$`. A glob, by contrast,
  matches the **whole string** (fnmatch), the same as a `/re/` wrapped in `^…$` —
  and `:match` shares the regex rule. On the RHS a leading-slash word is the regex
  only when its base (minus trailing `:` modifiers, so `/\d+/:i` counts) is a clean
  `/BODY/` (closing `/` final, no unescaped interior `/`); otherwise it is a path or
  glob, so both **relative** (`*.txt`) and **absolute** (`/usr/*/bin`, `/tmp/*`) globs
  are bare (full rule in [Quoting](#quoting-and-escaping)).
- **File tests** are the scalar cousins of the `:files`/`:f` filter modifiers.
  The type/permission axis is words: `$p:type` yields the `find -type` word
  (`file`/`dir`/`link`/…) so `$p:type == dir` is `-d`; `$p:exists` is `-e`;
  `$p:exec` / `$p:read` / `$p:write` are `-x` / `-r` / `-w`. (`-z`/`-n` are just
  `$s == ""` / `$s:len > 0`.) The **binary** file relations `-nt` / `-ot` / `-ef`
  (newer / older / same-inode) are the same comparison family as the
  [predicate qualifiers](#globbing) (`age < 1d`), spelled `$a:mtime > $b:mtime` and
  `$a:same($b)` rather than cryptic digraphs. Like `test`, these **dereference
  symlinks** — `:mtime`/`:atime`/`:ctime` and `:same` act on the link *target*, so a
  symlink and its target share an mtime and are `:same`; `:type == link` is how you
  ask about the link itself. A raw `$a:mtime > $b:mtime` requires **both** files to
  exist (strict absence errors on a missing operand); `-nt`'s quirk of treating a
  *missing* target as older is the rebuild idiom, written explicitly as
  `$a:exists and (not $b:exists or $a:mtime > $b:mtime)`. These ride on the **time model**
  *(decided, porting `age()`)*: `now()` and the file-time modifiers
  (`:mtime`/`:atime`/`:ctime`) return an **`Instant`**, and `Instant - Instant` is
  a **`Duration`** (`age = now() - $f:mtime`). A `Duration` is written with **suffix
  literals** — `500ms`, `3s`, `5m`, `2h`, `7d`, units up through **days** (no week or
  year — not fixed-length), compounding as `2h30m` — and **prints canonically**, so
  the prompt timer is `took $elapsed` with no `/1000`. Arithmetic is the closed set
  `Duration ± Duration`, `Duration × n`, `Instant ± Duration → Instant`, and
  `Instant - Instant → Duration` (`Instant + Instant` is an error). Division is
  **not** in the set — for a ratio, drop to an integer first with `:ms` / `:secs`,
  which **truncate toward zero** (`(now() - $t):ms` drops any sub-millisecond
  remainder toward zero); then
  `$a:ms / $b:ms` is ordinary integer division, so no float or rational type has to
  be introduced. A `Duration`
  is **signed** — `Instant - Instant` goes negative for a future instant (so a
  future-dated file's `age` is just negative, not an error or a saturated zero),
  rendering with a leading `-` (`-3s`). `Instant` and `Duration` are
  **nanosecond**-resolution internally, so sub-millisecond file-time differences
  still compare correctly (`$a:mtime > $b:mtime`, the `-nt` replacement); literals
  only reach down to `ms`, and canonical rendering stops at `ms` — any finer
  remainder is dropped from the *printed* form but kept for comparison and
  arithmetic. A `Duration`'s **canonical spelling** uses the largest units that fit
  with no zero components (`90s` → `1m30s`, `3000ms` → `3s`), bottoms out at `ms`,
  writes zero as `0s`, and prefixes a negative value's whole form with `-`
  (`-1m30s`). Any magnitude that rounds below the `ms` floor — including a wholly
  sub-millisecond duration like `500µs` — renders as `0s` too, and there is **no
  negative zero**: a value that renders as zero is always `0s`, never `-0s` or `0ms`.
  An **`Instant` has no canonical text form**: interpolating, `puts`-ing,
  or passing one to argv is a **loud error** — epoch-vs-ISO and the timezone are a
  guess, the same no-guess-at-the-boundary rule as an un-spread list — so render it
  explicitly with `$t:epoch` (integer seconds), `$t:iso` (UTC ISO-8601 with a
  literal `Z` suffix and exactly nine fractional-second digits), or
  `$t:format(…)`. A bare
  integer is **not** a
  Duration (the ms-vs-s footgun mesh kills), but the process boundary stays bytes, so
  an external `sleep 2` still passes `"2"` — the type governs only *in-shell* values.
  One literal grammar then unifies the glob `age < 1d` predicate, file-time
  comparisons, `retry --sleep 2s`, and the prompt's `took 3s`. *(TODO — **timezone /
  calendar handling** deferred: `Instant` parse and format (`$t:format("%F %T")`,
  `"…":datetime`, and the tz conversion behind `tz2tz`/`udate`/`utc2`) delegate to
  `date` for now; consider a native tz-aware datetime later, weighed against simply
  shelling out.)*
- **Combine** bools with the words `and` / `or` / `not` (`if $a:exists and not
  $b:exists { … }`). These join *values*; the byte-stream **command** chains
  `&&` / `||` (run-next-on-success/failure, by exit status) are kept separately
  and unchanged — two different jobs that bash blurs.

So `case` → `match`, and the everyday `[[ … ]]` jobs map to a comparison, a `~`
pattern-match, a file-test modifier, or an `and`/`or`/`not` of those — no
special `[[` context, and none of its word-splitting quirks. The binary file
relations (`-nt`/`-ot`/`-ef`) are settled above as `$a:mtime > $b:mtime` and
`$a:same($b)`. Regex **captures** (bash's `BASH_REMATCH`) are settled too: they go
through the value-side `:match` extractor, and a `/re/` `match` arm does **not**
auto-bind (see [Matching](#matching-match)) — so `~` stays a pure predicate.

### Error handling

mesh keeps **two distinct failure channels** and deliberately does not merge them
the way bash does (into "empty string, exit 1"):

- **Value-level failure** — a `false`, a nonzero `int`, or a command's exit
  status. This is *not* an interruption: it is a **value** you branch on (`if`,
  `while`, `&&` / `||`, `and` / `or` / `not`). It is the whole of the
  [result/status model](#functions) — failure here is signalled by a `false` /
  nonzero-int / command-status, **never** by the *shape* of a value.
- **Errors ("fail loud")** — a value the code *required* is absent or ill-typed:
  a destructure length mismatch (`[a b c] = two_items`), an out-of-range index
  (`$xs[99]`), a bare [`:match`](#destructuring) miss, undecodable text where text
  is required, a type error. These produce **no value** — they **abort the current
  statement** and surface loudly. They live *outside* the value/status model: not a
  `false` you might accidentally test as truthy, but an interruption you can't miss.

The split exists because "the command found nothing" (channel 1 — normal, testable)
and "the code asked for something that isn't there" (channel 2 — a bug) are
genuinely different, and collapsing them is the source of a whole class of silent
shell bugs.

**Strict by default, soft by opt-in.** Fail-loud is the *default*; every strict
operation that can be legitimately "maybe absent" has a **soft twin**, and *which
construct you write* is how you declare whether absence is a bug or expected:

| Intent | Strict — errors (channel 2) | Soft — yields a value (channel 1) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bind N names from a list | `[a b] = xs` | `if [a b] = xs { … }` — a miss skips |
| a captured group | `[x] = s:match(/re/)` | `if [x] = s:match(/re/) { … }` |
| index an element | `$xs[i]` | `$xs:get(i, default)` — total, never errors |
| a map value | `$m.key` | `$m:get(key, default)` |
| read a line | — | `gets()` → `false` at EOF |
| a branch's value | — | `if cond { v }` → `""` when false |

So absence is loud when you **asserted** the value is there (a bare bind, a direct
`[i]`) and quiet when you **asked whether** it is (`if`-binding, `:get`, `gets`, a
no-`else` `if`). You never get bash's silent-empty-*by-default*; softness is
explicit. The soft index accessor is the existing two-arg [`$xs:get(i,
default)`](#arrays-lists) rather than a `:get(i)` that returns a bare `false` or a
`:get():default()` chain — deliberately, because the two-arg form does the bounds
check *internally* and so can still distinguish "element `i` is genuinely `false` /
`""`" from "there is no element `i`," which a returned-sentinel chain cannot. That
is the same no-null reasoning as everywhere else: don't let one value stand in for
both "empty" and "absent."

**`if` with no `else` is a soft form, not a suppressed error.** A false condition
is a normal outcome, not a failure, so `tag = if $root { "[root]" }` yielding `""`
when not root is the *soft channel producing the "nothing" value* — exactly
parallel to `gets()` producing `false` — and is consistent with fail-loud, which
governs only *required* positions. The residual edge is stated honestly: `""`-as-
nothing is indistinguishable from a real empty string and flows downstream under
[no-null](#variables-and-assignment), so a no-`else` `if` is the one place mesh
hands you a silent empty that a destructure would refuse. That is the accepted cost
of the terse one-liner ([Conditionals](#conditionals-if-is-an-expression),
"Decided: lenient"); the only lever to close it — requiring `else` in *binding*
position — was weighed and declined for ergonomics.

**Recovery — the shell contains errors at interactive boundaries.** A channel-2
error has to land somewhere; the rule is where:

- **Interactive line** — the error aborts that line, prints, and returns to a fresh
  prompt. The session never dies.
- **`source FILE`** — a *parse* error rejects the whole file (none of it runs, so a
  bad rc can't leave a half-defined config); a *runtime* error aborts the file at
  that point. Whether that error is then **contained or propagated depends on
  interactivity**, not on `source` itself: in an **interactive** shell it is
  contained — surfaced, and the shell keeps running so a broken `rc.mesh` never
  bricks your session — whereas in a **non-interactive** shell it **propagates** as
  an uncaught channel-2 error and follows the batch rule below (the sourcing
  script fails hard; subsequent deploy/mutation commands do *not* run). Containment
  is an interactive affordance, never a blanket swallow.
- **Prompt / hook / completion callback** — the shell **catches** the error at the
  dispatch boundary, reports it (above the fresh prompt), and continues with a
  degraded result — that one prompt segment is dropped, not the whole prompt. A
  buggy config *shows* its bug without bricking interactivity: fail-loud and
  keep-running at once. (This boundary-catch is interactive-only for the same
  reason; a hook firing in a non-interactive run propagates like any other error.)
- **Script / `-c` / non-interactive** — an uncaught error exits nonzero (the batch
  contract), so automation still fails hard. This is the rule a propagated
  sourced-file or hook error lands in.

*(Open — the catch question: whether mesh also exposes a **user-facing** recovery
form — a `try` / `catch`, or an Elvish-style `?(…)` capture that converts a
channel-2 error into a channel-1 value — for the cases with no soft twin (a type
error, div-by-zero, undecodable text), or whether the strict/soft pairs plus the
boundary-catch above suffice for the MVP. Leaning: ship the boundary-catch and the
soft twins, **no** user `try` / `catch` in the MVP, since interactive use rarely
needs to programmatically recover from a genuine bug; revisit for scripting.)*

### Loops (`for`, `while`, `loop`)

Same brace-delimited shape as `func` and `if` — **no `do` / `done`**. The header
carries no parentheses, Go-style:

```
for f in * {
  …
}
```

Take the loop that motivated this section — "walk a directory, skip the
subdirectories":

```bash
# bash
for f in *; do
  test -d "$f" && continue
  process "$f"
done
```

Two things make that fussier than it should be, and both are things mesh already
fixed elsewhere:

1. `*` **word-splits**, so `$f` *must* be quoted or a filename with a space
   breaks the loop.
2. There is no way to say "only files," so you filter by hand with
   `test -d … && continue`.

`*` is a real list and `$f` is one element that never splits, so the quotes just
go away:

```
# mesh — direct translation, no quoting needed
for f in * {
  if $f:type == dir { continue }
  process $f
}
```

…and the **idiomatic** version deletes the guard, because the glob already
*types* its matches — `(f)` is "plain files," straight from `find -type`
([Globbing](#globbing)):

```
# mesh — filter at the source; the loop body has nothing to skip
for f in *(f) {
  process $f
}
```

That is the ergonomic payoff: the most common reason for a `continue` at the top
of a shell loop (wrong file type) is gone, because filtering lives in the glob.
`continue` and `break` are still there for the cases that need them — kept
as-is, familiar.

**Iterating other things** — anything that is a list, plus maps and ranges,
reusing syntax already defined:

```
for line in $(git status --porcelain) {   # a capture: splits on newlines — safe
  …
}
for host, addr in $known_hosts {           # a map yields key, value pairs
  puts "$host is $addr"
}
for i in 1..=5 {                           # a range: same .. / ..= as slices
  echo $i
}
```

The map form (`k, v`) and the range form need nothing new — they are the `[k:
v]` maps and `..`/`..=` ranges from earlier, showing up where a loop expects a
list.

**Reach for a modifier before a loop when you are *transforming*.** A `for` loop
is for side effects; to *derive* a list you usually do not need one, because
value modifiers already map over a list:

```
stems = $files:stem       # not: stems = []; for f in $files { stems += [$f:stem] }
```

**`while`** is the same shape, with an `if`-style condition (a bool or a
command's exit status); **`loop`** is the infinite form, exited with `break`
(clearer than `while true`, borrowed from Rust):

```
while $queue:len > 0 {
  handle ($queue:first)
  queue = $queue:rest
}

loop {
  if deploy-succeeded { break }   # run until a condition breaks out
  sleep 5
}
```

mesh deliberately keeps a **separate `while`** rather than folding it into `for`
the way Go does: `while` is muscle memory every shell user already has, and
familiarity outranks shaving a keyword. `loop` fills Go's bare-`for {}` niche
without overloading `for`. So three keywords, each doing one obvious thing —
`for` iterates, `while` tests, `loop` repeats.

The one-line skip idiom is the **postfix guard** (`continue if $f:type == dir`),
now decided — see [Conditionals](#conditionals-if-is-an-expression). The
file-test modifiers it leans on (`$f:type` / `:exists` / `:exec`) are settled in
[Tests and comparisons](#tests-and-comparisons).

### Redirection

Redirection is **basically bash** — the operators are too familiar and too
ergonomic to reinvent, and they plumb a command's byte streams, which is
orthogonal to mesh's value model. The same set:

```
cmd > file          # stdout, truncate
cmd >> file         # stdout, append
cmd < file          # stdin
cmd 2> file         # stderr
cmd 2>&1            # stderr to wherever stdout currently goes
cmd &> file         # both stdout and stderr (>& also accepted)
cmd 2>> file        # stderr, append
cmd > /dev/null     # discard
a | b               # pipe: a's stdout to b's stdin (the byte-stream pipe)
a |& b              # pipe stdout AND stderr (shorthand for a 2>&1 | b)
cmd << END … END    # here-document
cmd <<< "text"      # here-string
cmd 3< file         # explicit fd; n>&m dup, n>&- close
diff <(a) <(b)      # process substitution (a filename/fd, bash-compatible)
```

Two mesh notes, neither a behavior change:

- A redirection operator is its **own lexical token**, so it is **exempt from the
  [operators-need-spaces](#globbing) rule** — `cmd 2>&1` and `cmd >file` both
  parse as in bash; the spacing rule is only about word operators like `-`.
- Redirection moves **bytes to/from files and fds** — it does *not* interact with
  the rich value channel. A list or map is not "redirected"; you print it
  (`puts $xs > file`) and the command's stdout is what lands. This is the same
  bytes-vs-values split as [command substitution](#command-substitution) and
  [export](#variables-and-assignment).
- A **here-document** `<< END … END` **interpolates** by default — `$var` and the
  `"…"` escape set apply, as inside double quotes — and a **quoted delimiter**
  `<< 'END' … END` makes it **raw** (no interpolation, no escapes), the bash
  convention. The quoted-delimiter form is mesh's raw **both-quote-kinds** string: it
  holds `'` and `"` freely with no escaping. Using a heredoc as a **value**
  (`re(<< 'END' … END)`, `x = << END … END`) rather than a command's stdin is still
  to be specified (see [`TODO.md`](TODO.md)); the interpolate-unless-quoted rule
  applies to both uses.

*(open: `noclobber` and the `>|` override; whether `&>>` append-both is worth a
spelling.)*

**`exec` replaces the process image** *(decided — porting `autosession`, `logexec`)*.
`exec CMD …` replaces the current shell process with the command — the standard
`exec(2)` hand-off — so a dispatcher/wrapper (`autosession` → `exec autotmux …`,
`logexec` → `exec "$0".distrib`) leaves no parent shell behind: ordinary invocation
of an **external executable** runs a child, while `exec` *becomes* that external.
`exec` accepts only external executables; functions and built-ins have no process
image with which to replace the shell. (`exec` with only redirections and no
command applies them to the current shell, bash's `exec >log`.)

**Per-stream tty tests** *(decided — porting `confirm`)*. `$sh.interactive` answers
"is this an interactive shell," but a function sometimes needs "is *this stream* a
terminal" — `confirm` guards on `test -t 0 && test -t 2`. That is **`$sh.stdin:tty` /
`$sh.stdout:tty` / `$sh.stderr:tty`** — each a bool, the `test -t N` replacement,
under the `sh` namespace (a bare `$stdin` is an ordinary user variable under the
two-reserved-names rule).

*(TODO — **output process substitution `>(cmd)`**. The input form `<(cmd)` and
explicit fds / dup / close are settled above; the output form (`filter`'s
`3> >(cmd)`) is not — decide whether to add it.)*

### Job control

Job control is table stakes for an interactive shell, and mesh's one improvement
over bash/zsh is that **jobs are first-class values**, not an opaque table you
reach only through the `%n` sigil and scrape out of `jobs` text.

**`$sh.jobs` is an insertion-ordered map keyed by a small stable job id**, each
value a record:

```
$sh.jobs
# [ 1: [pid: 48213, cmd: "make -j8", state: running, status: ""],
#   2: [pid: 49001, cmd: "vim notes", state: stopped, status: ""] ]

$sh.jobs:len              # 2   — this is `publish-jobs`, now one word in a prompt segment
$sh.jobs[2].state          # stopped
$sh.jobs:values:filter(func(j) { $j.state == running })
```

`state` is `running` / `stopped` / `done`; `status` fills in when a job finishes
(the same 8-bit view as [`$sh.status`](#variables-and-assignment)).

**`&` backgrounds and yields a job handle.** `j = make -j8 &` binds the record,
so `$j.pid` is mesh's replacement for bash's `$!` and `$j` is the thing you
`fg` / `kill` / `wait`. A bare `make &` just registers the job in `$sh.jobs`.

**The interactive verbs are the familiar ones:**

| Action | Spelling |
| --- | --- |
| suspend the foreground job | Ctrl-Z → a `stopped` job |
| foreground | `fg` (most recent) · `fg 2` · `fg %2` · `fg $j` |
| resume in background | `bg` · `bg 2` · `bg %2` |
| list | `jobs` (pretty-prints `$sh.jobs`) |
| signal | `kill $j` · `kill $sh.jobs[2]` · `kill %2` — but `kill 49001` is still a **PID** |
| wait for it | `wait $j` |

**Job references — three ways, no ambiguity.** `fg` / `bg` only ever take a job,
so a **bare id** there (`fg 2`) is unambiguous. The **handle** (`$sh.jobs[2]`, or
`$j` from `j = cmd &`) is the value-model reference and is what disambiguates
`kill` from a PID. And the **`%n` sigil is kept as sugar** for muscle memory —
`%2` (by id), **`%+`** / **`%%`** (current job), **`%-`** (previous job), and
`%string` (most recent whose command starts with `string`).

**Completion is reported before the next prompt** (like bash's `[2]+ Done`), and
the finished job's record carries its final `status` at that point before leaving
`$sh.jobs`.

*(deferred past the spike: `disown` / nohup-style persistence past shell exit;
`wait` with no args / multiple jobs and its aggregate status; the fuzzy
`%?string` (substring) reference; per-stage `pipestatus` on a backgrounded
pipeline; and a `jobdone` hook to fire on completion. Terminal plumbing —
process groups, `tcsetpgrp`, `SIGTSTP`/`SIGCONT` — is implementation, not
surface.)*

### Signals

**Interactive defaults** — the shell owns these at the prompt. The *keyboard*
signals never end your session; only a lost terminal (SIGHUP) does:

- **`Ctrl-C` / SIGINT** — at the prompt, **abandon the current input** and draw a
  fresh prompt (never exits the shell). While a foreground command runs, SIGINT
  goes to *that* [job](#job-control)'s process group; the shell stays up and the
  next prompt shows its interrupted [status](#variables-and-assignment).
- **`Ctrl-D` / EOF** — on an **empty** line, exit the shell; on a non-empty line it
  does nothing, so a stray `Ctrl-D` can't drop you mid-command. An
  **`$sh.options.ignore-eof`** setting can require a second press.
- **`Ctrl-Z` / SIGTSTP** — suspend the foreground job to a **stopped**
  [job](#job-control); at an idle prompt (no foreground job) it is **ignored** —
  the interactive shell never suspends itself.
- **`Ctrl-\` / SIGQUIT** — ignored at the prompt; delivered to the foreground job.
- **SIGWINCH** (resize) — the [line editor](#line-editing) reflows and redraws the
  (possibly multi-line) prompt.
- **SIGHUP** (terminal closed) — the shell exits, **SIGHUPs its jobs, then sends
  SIGCONT to any that are *stopped*** (a stopped job can't act on the HUP until it's
  continued; a running job just gets the HUP); **SIGTERM** is ignored interactively
  (as bash does). (A `disown` exemption from the HUP arrives with `disown` itself,
  which is [deferred](#job-control).)

**User handlers are keyed hook maps, not bash's `trap`.** `$sh.signal.<NAME>` is an
insertion-ordered map of named callables — the *same shape* as `$sh.preprompt` and
the other [hooks](#hooks-and-the-prompt), so it is re-source-safe and composable,
with no new `trap` builtin:

```
$sh.signal.INT.note  = func() { puts "interrupted" }
$sh.signal.TERM.save = save-state                 # by name
$sh.signal.USR1.reload = reload-config             # a command/function, late-bound
unset $sh.signal.INT.note                          # remove one
```

Names drop the `SIG` prefix (`INT`, `TERM`, `HUP`, `USR1`, …). **`$sh.exit`** is
the EXIT-pseudo-signal trap (bash's `trap … EXIT`), already defined with the
[hooks](#hooks-and-the-prompt). **`SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` can't be trapped** (an OS
rule); assigning a handler for them is an error. A user handler runs *in addition
to* the shell's interactive default where both apply — the shell keeps terminal
control (the line-cancel / redraw still happens) and the handler runs for its
effect. **The handler runs first and the shell's terminal redraw is its final
step** — so any output a handler writes (`puts "interrupted"`) appears *before* the
fresh prompt is drawn, never stranded after it, and the line editor's displayed
buffer / cursor stay consistent (a WINCH handler's output likewise precedes the
reflow). Handlers fire for signals delivered while a script, function, or command
is running, matching where bash traps fire. And — as with `postexec` / `preprompt`
dispatch — **`$sh.status` and `$sh.pipestatus` are snapshotted and restored** across
a handler, so a command the handler runs (that `puts`) can't overwrite the
interrupted foreground status the next prompt reports.

*(deferred: whether a handler may **suppress** a default (e.g. swallow `Ctrl-C`);
exact SIGINT delivery mid-pipeline; and per-signal masking during handler
execution.)*

### Startup and invocation

**Config files** live under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mesh` (default `~/.config/mesh/`),
sourced in order by shell kind — the zsh split, XDG-located and mesh-named:

- **`env.mesh`** — *every* mesh, including non-interactive scripts: environment
  and `$env.PATH` setup. Kept small and fast, because scripts pay for it on
  every run.
- **`login.mesh`** — login shells only, after `env.mesh`: once-per-login setup.
- **`rc.mesh`** — interactive shells, after the above: the *interactive* rc where
  prompt segments, hooks, keybindings, and functions live. This is the file the
  whole design has been targeting.
- **`logout.mesh`** — on login-shell exit.

Order: `env` → (login) `login` → (interactive) `rc`, and `logout` on the way out.

**Invocation & flags** are the familiar surface:

```
mesh                       # interactive shell when stdin is a tty
mesh script.mesh a b c     # run a script; a b c become $sh.args
mesh -c "puts hi" a b      # run a command string; a b become $sh.args
mesh -s                    # read commands from stdin
mesh -i                    # force interactive
mesh -l / --login          # login shell (also sources login.mesh)
mesh --rcfile FILE         # use FILE instead of rc.mesh
mesh --norc                # skip rc.mesh
mesh --version / --help
```

Script and positional args are a **real list**, **`$sh.args`** (`$sh.args:len`
for the count, `$sh.args[0]` for the first — none of `$1` / `$@` / `$#`), and
**`$sh.name`** is the shell-or-script name (bash's `$0`). Both are read-only
runtime entries.

*(TODO: **am-I-sourced, and the current source file.** A file needs to know both
that it is being **`source`d** (vs run as a script, a `-c` command string, `-s`
stdin, or typed interactively) and the **path of the file currently being
sourced** — bash's `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` and the `[[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != "$0" ]]`
idiom, which real rc files use to locate sibling files and to guard "only when
executed directly" blocks. Model the two axes **orthogonally**: an input **origin**
— `script` / `sourced` / `command` (`-c`) / `stdin` (`-s`) / `interactive` — kept
separate from **interactivity**, since `mesh -i script.mesh` is interactive *and* a
script; interactivity is already [`$sh.interactive`](#variables-and-assignment).
Then a read-only **`$sh.source`** carries the path of the file being evaluated,
defined only for the **file** origins (`script` / `sourced`) and empty for
`command` / `stdin` / `interactive`. `$sh.name` (bash's `$0`) is not enough — it
doesn't change on `source` and can't locate the sourced file. Decide whether
`$sh.source` nests (a stack, for a file that sources another) or reports only the
innermost.)*

*(deferred: system-wide `/etc/mesh/*` files; mutating positional args
(`shift` / `set --`); and whether a non-login, non-interactive script should skip
`env.mesh` for speed.)*

### Built-ins

The MVP built-in set is deliberately small — most "commands" are external
programs or user functions:

- **Navigation**
  - **`cd [DIR]`** — change directory. No arg → `$env.HOME`; **`cd -`** → the
    previous dir (`$env.OLDPWD`); a *relative* `DIR` that does **not** begin with
    `./` or `../` is searched in `CDPATH`. A **dot-relative** operand (`./child`,
    `../sib`) always resolves from the current directory, never through `CDPATH` —
    the conventional POSIX exemption, so `cd ../` can't jump to a `CDPATH` entry. It
    updates `$env.PWD` / `$env.OLDPWD` and fires the
    [`precd` / `postcd`](#hooks-and-the-prompt) hooks. Logical by default;
    **`--physical` / `-P`** resolves symlinks first. The block form `in DIR { }` is
    the scoped `pushd` / `popd`.
  - **`pwd`** — the working directory. The shell **maintains the logical cwd
    itself** (updated by `cd` / autocd), so `pwd` reports *that* shell-owned value —
    validated against the real directory and recomputed if a stale or forged
    `$env.PWD` has diverged, so `pwd` can't lie. Run bare it **prints** the path; the
    **value call `pwd()` returns** the same validated cwd as a string value — so
    `pwd():ancestors` and `style(pwd(), fg: blue)` read the authoritative path, never
    the raw `$env.PWD`. **`--physical` / `-P`** calls `getcwd` for the symlink-resolved
    path.
  - **Autocd** — a bare word in command position that is a **directory path ending
    in `/`** (`src/`, `../`, `/tmp/`) is a `cd` into it, no `cd` keyword needed. The
    **trailing slash is the signal** — and it's what makes this safe where zsh's
    slashless autocd isn't: a slashless `src` stays an ordinary command lookup (so a
    command that shares a directory's name is never shadowed), and only the explicit
    `src/` means "go there." Because it *is* a `cd`, a relative target honors
    [`CDPATH`](#variables-and-assignment) — `proj/` resolves through `CDPATH`
    exactly as `cd proj` would, and the same **dot-path exemption** applies, so
    `../` and `./sub/` resolve from the current directory rather than a `CDPATH`
    entry. It fires for a **lone** word only (`src/ x` runs
    `src/` as a command); a trailing-slash word whose target isn't a directory is a
    *no-such-directory* error, not command-not-found. On by default —
    `$sh.options.autocd = off` disables it.
- **I/O**
  - **`puts [args…]`** — one order-preserving rule: **render each argument to
    text** — a scalar as itself, a **list** as its elements joined by newlines (a
    list *is* a sequence of lines), a **map** as `key: value` entries joined by
    newlines; a value with **no canonical byte form** — an `Instant`, a `regex`, a
    stream handle — is a **loud error** here, exactly as at the argv boundary above,
    never a guessed rendering — then **join the arguments with a single space** and append a trailing
    newline. So `puts a b` → `a b`, `puts $(ls)` → one file per line, and a mixed
    `puts head $xs tail` is fully defined by that rule. `puts` can render rich values
    because it is a **built-in** on real values — an *external* command still needs
    bytes (spread or [`:join`](#spread--flattening)). It takes **no flags** — none of
    `echo`'s `-e` / `-n` reinterpretation, since escapes are resolved by the
    [string literal](#quoting-and-escaping).
  - **`print [args…]`** — identical, but with **no trailing newline** — for partial
    lines and hand-built prompts. The `puts` / `print` pair replaces `echo -n`,
    keeping both flag-free.
  - **`gets [var]`** — read one line from stdin into `var` (trailing newline
    stripped) and return that line as its value. **At EOF it returns `false`**
    (whose [status](#variables-and-assignment) is `1`) and leaves `var` unchanged,
    so `while gets line { … }` terminates. An empty line still reads as a truthy
    `""` — only EOF is `false` — so blank lines don't end the loop. With no `var`
    it just yields the line (or `false`).
- **Formatting** — `style` (produce a [styled value](#hooks-and-the-prompt) for
  the prompt); it must be a built-in because a structured return value can't come
  from an external command.
- **Vars / env** — `export`, `unset`, `global`, and `source FILE` to (re-)load a
  file — re-sourcing your rc is safe because [hooks are keyed](#hooks-and-the-prompt).
- **Jobs** — `fg`, `bg`, `jobs`, `kill`, `wait` ([Job control](#job-control)).
- **History** — `history` (list past commands; `history | grep` is the MVP search —
  see [Interactive history](#interactive-history)).
- **Process** — **`exec CMD …`** replaces the shell process with the command (the
  `exec(2)` hand-off; ordinary invocation runs a child instead). `CMD` resolves as
  an **external executable** — function and built-in lookup is bypassed, since there
  is no process image to replace the shell with otherwise, so a name that is only a
  function or built-in (`exec cd`, `exec my-wrapper`) is an **error**. With only
  redirections and no command it applies them to the current shell (bash's `exec >log`).
- **Values** — **`re(STR)`** builds a [regex value](#tests-and-comparisons) from a
  string — a built-in constructor, since a rich value can't come from an external —
  with `re(STR, literal: true)` for verbatim matching. **`glob(STR)`** is *not* a value
  constructor — it **expands** a (runtime-built or absolute) pattern to its matching
  **paths**, a [list](#arrays-lists), since globbing is filesystem expansion, not a
  pattern object; its match-side twin **`fnmatch(STR, PAT)`** returns a bool for
  "does this string match this glob pattern" with no filesystem access. **`files(DIR=.)`**
  and **`dirs(DIR=.)`** are the [wrapper](#globbing) expansions — `glob` over a
  directory's immediate entries preset to `type: file` / `type: dir` — returning a
  path [list](#arrays-lists). `style` (above) is the styled-value constructor.
- **Session** — `exit [status]`.

**No aliases.** mesh drops the alias mechanism entirely: a **function** is just
as terse (`func ll(...args) { ls -l --color ...$args }`), and it composes, scopes,
and takes arguments properly, so there's no second half-language of "short
names." A bare word that is neither a function nor a built-in is a
command-not-found error, never a silently-expanded alias.

### Line editing

The interactive read loop — cursor motion, kill/yank, multi-line editing, history
recall, completion — is built on a **line-editor library**, not hand-rolled,
chosen so the keybinding and completion model stays configurable later. The pick
is **reedline** (nushell's editor, **MIT-licensed**): it already models swappable
keybinding maps (emacs *and* vi), completion menus, hints/autosuggestions, a
syntax-highlight hook, multi-line validation, and pluggable history — so mesh's
future "configure your keys from `rc.mesh`" surface is mostly a matter of exposing
what reedline already has. A deciding factor is **word-boundary editing** — good
word motions and word-kills (`Ctrl-W`, `Alt-B`/`Alt-F`, `Alt-D`) are exactly the
everyday ergonomics that matter, and reedline handles them well where **libedit
is poor** and **readline is workable but not ergonomic**. Both viable candidates
are permissively licensed (reedline and the fallback **rustyline** are MIT); GNU
readline is avoided as GPL.

**MVP: bindings are hardcoded emacs/friendly** — `Ctrl-A`/`Ctrl-E` for line ends,
`Ctrl-B`/`Ctrl-F` and arrows to move, `Ctrl-W` / `Alt-Backspace` word-kill,
`Ctrl-U`/`Ctrl-K` line-kill, `Ctrl-Y` yank, `Alt-.` (Esc + `.`) to insert the
**last argument** of the previous command (repeat to walk earlier commands' last
args; it obeys the same [session selection rule](#interactive-history) as the other
recall motions), `Ctrl-R` reverse history search, up/down for **prefix** history search (a
typed prefix filters the walk; see [Interactive history](#interactive-history)),
`Tab` to complete, `Ctrl-L` to
clear. **Multi-line
continuation** is driven by **parser incompleteness** — the editor asks the
parser whether the buffer is a complete command and, if not, reads a continuation
line — so *every* unfinished form is covered uniformly rather than by an
enumerated token list: an unclosed `{` / `[` / `(` / quote, or a trailing binary
connector (`|`, `|&`, `&&`, `||`) or line-continuation `\`. The editor owns
rendering the [prompt](#hooks-and-the-prompt) segment map and its multi-line
redraw.

*(TODO — gap surfaced porting a vi NORMAL/INSERT prompt indicator
(`keymap_character`): the [prompt segment map](#hooks-and-the-prompt) is evaluated
**once before** the editor runs, but the vi keymap changes **during** editing, and
mesh exposes neither the live keymap as a value nor a redraw hook when it changes.
zsh solves this with a `zle-keymap-select` widget that redraws a mode indicator
reactively. Decide how to surface the active keymap (e.g. a `$sh.keymap` a segment
can read) plus the on-mode-change **redraw** a reactive indicator needs.)*

*(deferred: exposing the **keybinding config** from `rc.mesh` — the whole reason
for the library choice — plus a vi mode, custom widgets, fish-style
autosuggestions, and syntax highlighting.)* Completion runs *through* the editor's
menu; its model is the next section.

### Completion

Completion has three targets — **files, directories, and command arguments** —
and the distinctive choice is that command-argument completion is
**auto-generated, never hand-written**: no bash/zsh-style completion scripts to
maintain, in the spirit of fish's `--help`/man-page scraping.

**One spec per command, generated for you.** There is a single notion of a
per-command **spec** — its subcommands, flags, and which arguments expect a
file / dir / enum value. A spec is found by a layered resolver:

1. a **curated spec file** if one exists (a drop-in override) —
   `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mesh/completions/` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME` defaulting to
   `~/.local/share`);
2. else a spec **parsed from the command's man page** — *when that page can be
   associated with the resolved executable* (same package / install). It needs
   *no execution*, so it is preferred; but a system page is **not** trusted for a
   `PATH`-shadowing local binary (a project-local `./tool` must not inherit
   `/usr/bin/tool`'s page), which instead falls through to the probe;
3. else a spec **auto-generated from `cmd --help`** — the executing probe, for
   external commands only;
4. else plain **file / dir** completion — the universal fallback.

Both generated specs are **cached** under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mesh/completions/`
(`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` defaulting to `~/.cache`), keyed by **the source that produced
them** so each regenerates when *its own* input changes: a `--help` spec by the
binary's path + mtime, a man-page spec by the **selected page's path + mtime**
(plus the `MANPATH` / locale that selected it) — so a docs-only package update or
a `MANPATH`/locale change re-parses rather than serving a stale spec.

Files and dirs are not a separate mechanism; they are the built-in *value types* a
spec's arguments point at (`cd` completes dirs; a `--output FILE` flag completes
files). Every source — curated file, man page, `--help` — writes a spec of the
**same shape**, so there is one format and one resolver.

**In command position (word 0)** completion offers PATH executables, functions,
and built-ins. After that the spec drives it: subcommands, flags (`-x` / `--long`),
a flag's value (file / dir / enum), or a positional file / dir.

**Only external executables are ever run.** The `--help` probe applies solely to a
resolved external binary; the shell never executes a **function** or **built-in**
to learn its arguments — it introspects them. In fact mesh gives **every function
a canned `--help`**, auto-generated from its declared **parameter signature** (its
positionals, `--switch` / `--flag`s, and `...rest`, see [Functions](#functions))
and emitted in the *same format the `--help` parser reads* — so `ll --help` prints
a real usage message **and** completion reads that same spec, both without running
the function. A function extends the generated help with a **docstring** (a
leading string in its body) for per-argument descriptions; the signature alone is
the zero-effort default. Built-ins ship their specs the same way. This is why the
[command-position](#completion) sources — functions and built-ins — need no probe.

The canned help never overrides the function's own contract: it is synthesized
**only when the signature does not itself claim `--help`** (a function that
declares a `--help` switch keeps it), and the `--` terminator still wins — a
literal `--help` after `--` reaches the body as data (`ll -- --help`), never the
auto-help. So the synthesized help fills the gap only where the function hasn't
spoken for the name.

**Generation is lazy.** A spec is generated the first time you complete
*arguments* for a command with no spec yet, then cached, so later Tabs never
regenerate. The man-page parse is tried first because it runs nothing; the
`--help` probe is the executing fallback.

**On executing `--help`:** it fires only at *argument* completion — after you have
already typed the command name and a space — so you have signaled intent to run
that command, and reading its `--help` is within that intent (you would have run
`cmd --help` yourself otherwise), not a surprise execution. It is still bounded:

- **stdin from `/dev/null`**, so a command that reads input can't hang the prompt;
- a **short timeout** with kill, and an **output-size cap**;
- an **opt-out denylist** for commands whose `--help` isn't safe, plus a global
  off switch **`$sh.options.complete.probe = off`** for anyone who wants *zero*
  implicit execution (curated specs, man pages, and file / dir still work);
- **conservative parsing** — recognize the `-x` / `--long` / `--long=VAL` /
  subcommand-table shapes; if parsing yields nothing, silently fall back to
  file / dir.

(`--help` is side-effect-free by near-universal convention, and clap / cobra /
argparse output is regular enough to parse — the bet fish makes; the
man-page-first order and the off switch cover the rest.)

**Override hook.** The **`$sh.complete`** map — keyed by command, each value a spec
*or* a callable returning candidates — overrides or augments the auto-generated
spec, matching the keyed-map pattern used for [hooks](#hooks-and-the-prompt).
Auto-generation stays the zero-config default; this is where a *dynamic* completer
(git branches, a live PID list) goes.

*(deferred: the exact spec-file format; the function-docstring format; dynamic
value providers; recursive per-subcommand `--help` probing; and shared/remote spec
repos. The match/menu UI itself is the [line editor](#line-editing)'s.)*

### Interactive history

This is the history **store and recall**; the history *expansion* syntax
(`!!` / `^old^new`) is specified in [History expansion](#history-expansion) below.

**The store is SQLite** at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mesh/history.sqlite3` (`$XDG_STATE_HOME`
defaulting to `~/.local/state` — history is per-machine *state*, not cache or
config). A flat history *file* would force `grep` for everything; a small database
gives structured columns now and real search later, without committing to a query
UI yet.

**Every entry is rich, and the [hooks](#hooks-and-the-prompt) already populate it**
— history is just a built-in consumer of `preexec` / `postexec`, no new machinery:

| Column | Filled at | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | `preexec` | the command line **after history expansion** — what actually ran, so `!!` never stores literally `!!` |
| `cwd` | `preexec` | `$env.PWD` at submit |
| `tty` | `preexec` | the session's terminal |
| `session` | `preexec` | the interactive session id |
| `start` | `preexec` | submit timestamp |
| `duration` | `postexec` | how long it ran |
| `status` | `postexec` | the [exit status](#variables-and-assignment) |

**Recall** is the [line editor](#line-editing)'s, reading from this store, with two
motions: **`Ctrl-R`** does reverse *substring* search, and **up/down do prefix
search** — with a prefix already typed, `Up` walks the most recent commands that
*start with* it (an empty buffer just steps chronologically). So typing `git ` then
`Up` cycles your recent `git …` lines — the friendly default.

**Recall and expansion draw from your session plus finished history.** `Up`,
`Ctrl-R`, `Alt-.`, and the `!!` / `!$` / `!string` expansions all select from one
view: **this session's own rows together with every completed row from sessions
that are no longer live** — the full persisted history, *minus* the in-flight
commands of other **currently-live** sessions. So a fresh session still recalls
everything earlier sessions saved, while a command running *right now* in another
terminal never becomes your "previous" command. (Once that terminal exits its rows
become finished history and join the view; a mode that also pulls in *live* peers'
commands is a deferred opt-in.) The store stays **shared** — `history` lists and
searches across every session regardless.

**The MVP surface is a `history` built-in** that lists entries (newest last), and
**`history | grep foo`** is the MVP search — the whole point of a real store is
that richer queries (by cwd, by exit status, by time) can come later without
changing how entries are written. So `list | grep` is enough to ship. Only the **current session's own in-flight command** is excluded from what
`history` lists: its row is *recorded* at `preexec` (to capture `start` / `cwd` /
`tty`) but hidden until it completes, so `history | grep foo` never matches its own
pipeline. A row left incomplete — its owning session no longer live — is
**finalized at startup** (a null `status` / `duration`) rather than hidden forever,
so no real command is lost. **Liveness** is tracked by a per-session **lock
file** — `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mesh/sessions/<id>.lock` — on which the session holds an
**exclusive OS advisory lock** for its lifetime; the `sessions` record stores that
path plus the session's `pid` + boot time (an identity a recycled PID can't
counterfeit). A session is *live* iff its lock file's lock is still held, so startup
recovery finalizes an incomplete row only when the owning session's lock is unheld —
a still-running session's in-flight row is never mistaken for a crash.

*(deferred: an atuin-style fuzzy / interactive search over the columns; a
`$sh.history` value accessor for scripting; cross-session and cross-host sync;
the dedup policy; secret redaction; and import from bash/zsh history files.)*

### History expansion

For quick keyboard recall mesh keeps bash's `!` history expansion — but
**interactive-only and quote-safe**. It is a pre-parse pass that rewrites the input
line *before* parsing and runs **only in an interactive shell** (a script never
expands `!`), so it can never surprise non-interactive code. It reads from the
**same selection view** as the other [recall motions](#interactive-history) — this
session's rows plus finished (non-live) sessions' — so a fresh session's `!!` still
finds your last command, while another *live* terminal's commands never become your
`!!`.

- **`!!`** — the previous command line.
- **`!string`** — the most recent command that *starts with* `string`
  (`!git` → your last `git …`).
- **`!$`** — the last argument of the previous command *line*. Because expansion
  reads the stored history (not the current input), it refers to a *separately
  submitted* line: run `mkdir foo`, then on the next line `cd !$` → `foo` (not the
  same-line `mkdir foo; cd !$`, where `mkdir foo` isn't in history yet).
  (`!*` for all args, and `!n` / `!-n` by index, are natural extensions — deferred.)
- **Substitution** — two spellings: the terse **`^old^new`** for the everyday
  "fix my last command" (line-start; previous command), and a general
  **`:old=new`** modifier on *any* history reference (`!!:foo=bar`,
  `!git:foo=bar`). The `old=new` form reads as a *mapping* rather than importing
  sed's `s///` (which mesh uses nowhere else), and it **chains** like every other
  mesh `:` modifier — `!git:foo=bar:x=y` applies both in order. Replacement is
  **global** — every occurrence. The separator is the first *unquoted* `=`; for a
  pattern with spaces or a literal `=` / `:`, **quote each side**
  (`!git:"old thing"="new thing"`) or **backslash-escape**
  (`!git:old\ thing=new\ thing`). `^old^new` is just shorthand for `!!:old=new`.

**The `!` clash is resolved lexically:** `!` introduces an expansion only when
immediately followed by a **supported designator** — `!` (→ `!!`), `$` (→ `!$`), or
a word character (→ `!string`). A digit, `-`, or `*` does **not** activate
expansion in the MVP (they are reserved for the deferred `!n` / `!-n` / `!*`), and
neither do `=` / `~` (the operators `!=` / `!~`) or a lone `!` — all left literal. Two safety wins over bash: expansion happens **only unquoted** —
*both* single and double quotes make `!` literal (bash expanding `!` inside double
quotes is a classic footgun) — with `\!` to escape and a
**`$sh.options.histexpand = off`** switch to turn it off entirely.

### Hooks and the prompt

The requirement (from [Requirements](#requirements-carried-over-from-existing-configs)):
the prompt may be rendered by an external binary, *provided* override hooks — the
`ssh-add` "no identity" warning, a `[root]` tag, the session nag — can **layer
on top**, and **hooks compose, they do not replace each other**.

mesh models a hook point as an **insertion-ordered [map](#maps-associative-arrays)
of named callables** — the key is the handler's *identity*. That one choice
solves the composition requirement and the worst hook footgun at once:

- **Re-source-safe by construction.** `$sh.preprompt.git = …` is *keyed*, so running
  your rc file again **replaces** the `git` handler instead of stacking a
  duplicate — the bane of bash `PROMPT_COMMAND` (which appends) and zsh's
  `add-zsh-hook` (which needs manual dedup). The identity is what lets you
  re-source freely.
- **Update or drop one by name** — reassign `$sh.preprompt.git`, or `unset $sh.preprompt.git`
  — without touching the others; `$sh.preprompt:keys` introspects.
- **Deterministic order** — maps preserve insertion order, so handlers run
  (and segments render) in the order registered.
- **Compose, never replace** — adding a key leaves every other handler intact.

A handler value is a **command name or a callable**: a bareword is a string that
names a command/function run late-bound (matching the [command
namespace](#variables-and-assignment)), or a `func(){ … }` lambda for inline
logic.

**Event hooks** run for effect at named events, in symmetric `pre`/`post` pairs
plus the singletons — `preprompt` (before each prompt), the command pair
**`preexec`** (before a command runs, given the command line) / **`postexec`**
(after it finishes, given the command, its **exit status**, and **duration**),
the directory pair **`precd`** (before the cwd changes, still in the old dir,
given the target) / **`postcd`** (after, now in the new dir, given the previous
dir), and `exit`:

```
$sh.preprompt.jobs   = publish-jobs                    # by name
$sh.postcd.fetch  = func() { vcs auto-fetch & }     # arrived in a new dir — the PWD-gate is now the event itself
$sh.precd.save    = func(to) { save-dir-state }     # about to leave: act while still in the old dir
$sh.preexec.timer = func(cmd) { timer-start }       # start the clock…
$sh.postexec.timer = func(cmd, status, elapsed) { global last-cmd-time = $elapsed }   # …stop it; a Duration — `global` so it survives to feed the prompt
unset $sh.preprompt.jobs                               # remove one
```

The `pre`/`post` split (rather than a single after-the-fact hook) is what lets a
handler run *before* the transition — save state before leaving a dir, start a
timer before a command — separately from the after-work. The `preexec` /
`postexec` pair in particular is how the prompt's **last-exit status** and
**command timing** (both required dashboard fields) get fed without special
casing.

*(TODO — **terminal control: escapes & OSC features**. Surfaced porting
`title`/`set_title`/`init_title_sequences`, broadened to the whole surface. mesh
owns the line editor and prompt, so it should decide first-class handling — a hook,
a builtin, or automatic — for the escape/OSC features a modern interactive shell is
expected to drive, rather than leaving each to a hand-emitted `print "\e…"`:*
- ***Window/tab title*** *(OSC 0/1/2)* — set alongside the prompt, from `preexec`;
  needs the per-`$env.TERM` sequence choice (xterm `\e]0;…\a` vs screen/tmux
  `\ek…`). A `$sh.title` hook or a `set-title` builtin.
- ***Bracketed paste*** *(`\e[?2004h/l`)* — the editor must wrap pasted input so a
  multi-line paste is **inserted, not executed** line by line, and a lone newline in
  a paste doesn't submit. Almost certainly on by default, but it needs stating.
- ***Shell integration / semantic prompt marks*** *(OSC 133 `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`)* — mark
  prompt-start, command-start, output-start, and exit code so terminals (iTerm2, VS
  Code, WezTerm) can jump between prompts, fold command output, and badge exit
  status. mesh already has the exact `preexec`/`postexec`/prompt boundaries to emit
  these; decide whether it does so automatically.
- ***cwd reporting*** *(OSC 7)* — emit the cwd at startup / prompt render **and** on
  `postcd`, so a new terminal tab/split opens in the same directory even before the
  first `cd` (a fresh remote shell must report immediately, not only after a change).
- ***Hyperlinks*** *(OSC 8)* — clickable paths/URLs in output; likely a `style()`
  sibling (`link(text, url)`) rather than a raw escape, keeping color-as-data.
- ***Clipboard*** *(OSC 52)* — copy to the terminal's clipboard (works over ssh); a
  builtin.
- ***Notifications*** *(OSC 9 / 777)* — desktop notification, e.g. auto-notify when a
  long command finishes (pairs with the `postexec` duration).
- ***Cursor shape per mode*** *(DECSCUSR `\e[…q`)* — block in vi NORMAL, bar in
  INSERT; driven by the same mode-change event as the keymap-indicator TODO in the
  line-editor section.
- ***Synchronized output*** *(DEC private mode 2026, `CSI ?2026 h/l`)* — wrap the prompt / multi-line redraw so it
  updates atomically without flicker.

  Decide per feature: automatic, a hook/builtin, or out of scope (left to a
  hand-emitted `print "\e…"`).)*

**Command hooks fire for the outer interactive command only.** `preexec` /
`postexec` fire once for the command line you submit at the prompt — *not* for
commands run inside a function, a script, a `$(…)`, or a hook handler itself, and
a handler's own commands don't re-fire them. Without this, `$sh.preexec.timer`'s
`timer-start` would dispatch `preexec` again forever.

**Directory hooks fire around each actual `cd`** — `precd` *before* the
`chdir` (so it genuinely runs in the old dir, even for a `cd` inside a navigation
`func`), `postcd` *after* (in the new dir) — with the same guard that a `cd`
performed *by a hook handler* doesn't re-dispatch. A `func` that `cd`s internally
therefore fires them per change; if a handler only cares about net movement it
gates on `$env.PWD` itself (the one-line `precd`/`postcd` PWD-check that today's
config hand-rolls). Per-`cd` is the right default because `precd`'s "old dir"
contract can't hold if the hooks are deferred to function return. The pending
`cd` target is **resolved to an absolute path *before* `precd` runs**, so a
handler that itself `cd`s elsewhere (allowed — its change just doesn't
re-dispatch) can't make a *relative* outer `cd` land somewhere unintended.

**Status is snapshotted across hook dispatch.** The submitted command's exit
status (and pipeline stage statuses) are captured before `postexec` / `preprompt`
run, and **`$sh.status` and `$sh.pipestatus` are restored** to them for the
prompt segments — so a segment always sees the *interactive command's* status,
never the status of some command a handler happened to run. (`postexec` also
gets the status as an explicit `status` argument.)

**The prompt** is a named, insertion-ordered map where **each top-level entry is
one line**, rendered top to bottom. A line's value — a callable is evaluated to
produce it — is one of:

- a **renderable**: a plain string or a `style(…)` value (or `""` to contribute
  nothing → its line is skipped);
- a **flat list of renderables**: the inline pieces of the line, **space-joined,
  empties dropped** — the *same rule `puts` uses* for its arguments, so `[host-info
  dir-info auth-info]` reads like `puts host dir auth` and an empty middle piece
  never leaves a double space. Each piece **keeps its own style** (the pieces stay
  separate *values*; fold them into a string — `"$a$b"` — and the attributes flatten,
  since a string has nowhere to store per-piece color). *Tight* joining (`user@host`,
  no space) is not a list job: build it **inside a segment** as a string where you
  control every character — or, when the tight unit is also multi-color, as a
  `style([…])` [span](#hooks-and-the-prompt) (post-MVP). Line list = space-joined
  fields; segment string = character-level control;
- a **keyed sub-map** (`[host: …, dir: …]` — a map literal, `[ ]` not `{ }`): the
  *same* inline line, but each piece **named** so you can replace or `unset` it
  individually;
- a **structural value**: `rule` (a full-width line) or `newline` (a blank line) —
  each a **whole** line; or **`fill`**, the *inline* structural piece, used *within*
  a line's list (below).

A **bare word in a segment slot is the callable of that name** (late-bound, so
re-sourcing rebinds it — the by-name rule the hooks use); **quote it for a literal
string** (`host` calls the `host` segment, `"host"` renders the text). And
**multiple lines are multiple entries** — a list is always the pieces of *one*
line, never several lines. So there are no separator entries to name:

```
$sh.prompt.status = status-info                # a line — bare name = the status-info segment, by name
$sh.prompt.rule   = rule                       # a full-width line on its own
$sh.prompt.line1  = [host-info dir-info auth-info]   # ONE line: host (red) dir (blue) auth (yellow), each its own color
$sh.prompt.jobs   = job-info                   # its own line — skipped when empty
$sh.prompt.char   = func() { "> " }            # a func literal is fine too

# `fill` is the inline right-align / trailing-bar piece, when you want it:
$sh.prompt.line1  = [host-info dir-info fill clock-info]   # host dir on the left, clock flush-right
$sh.prompt.line1  = [host-info dir-info fill("─")]         # …or a bar to the right edge (`rule` ≡ a whole-line [fill("─")])

# named variant — same line, pieces individually addressable:
$sh.prompt.line1     = [host: host-info, dir: dir-info, auth: auth-info]
$sh.prompt.line1.dir = my-dir-info             # swap ONE piece by name
unset $sh.prompt.line1.auth                    # drop the auth warning

func host-info() { style("$(hostname)", fg: red) }     # `style` (not styled); comma-separated args; parens on the func
func dir-info()  { if inside-project() { "$(vcs prompt-info)" } else { style(tilde-pwd(), fg: blue) } }
func auth-info() { if ssh-id-missing() { style("SSH", fg: yellow) } }   # no else → "" → omitted
```

(Segments use `if` *expressions* to pick a string — not `and`/`or`, which combine
bools, not values — and the `auth` segment leans on the decided
no-`else`-yields-`""` rule so "not applicable" is just an empty contribution. The
`nl1` / `nl2` separator keys an earlier draft needed are gone: lines come from the
map's shape, and the only structural entries — `rule`, a deliberate blank
`newline` — carry *meaningful* names, never a positional filler like `nl3`.)

**Color comes from a `style` helper, not raw escapes.** The value call
`style("no-ssh-id", fg: yellow, bold: true)` returns a **styled value** — text and
style attributes kept apart — rather than baked-in ANSI. It is an ordinary value
call, so it takes attached parens and `--flag` arguments like any other; a *bare*
`style …` would run it in command position and yield a status, not the value
(hence the parens in the example above).

This falls out of the general [`$(…)`-vs-`()` split](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas):
**`()` yields a structured value, `$(…)` yields raw output.** A **renderable** is
therefore one of two things:

- a **styled value** (from a `()` call to `style`) — text and attributes kept
  separate, so the shell measures display width from the text *and* can strip or
  re-theme the styling (needed for the later transient/collapsed form). Because the
  attributes are data, `style` is also where **color downgrade** lives: it drops the
  styling automatically when output is not a color-capable tty or when **`NO_COLOR`**
  is set, so there is no config-visible `$color` flag or capability probe to manage; or
- a **plain string** — which may carry its own ANSI escapes, as an external
  renderer captured with `$(vcs prompt-info)` does (externals have no return
  value, so the renderer necessarily comes in through the output lane). The shell
  measures visible width by **skipping SGR (color/style) sequences** — the
  `ESC [ … m` family, which are genuinely zero-width — treating them as opaque and
  un-restylable. A plain string that emits **cursor-positioning or other non-SGR
  control** sequences is *outside* the width contract: those move the cursor, so
  the shell can't treat them as zero-width, and a prompt segment is expected to
  produce styled text, not drive the cursor.

So width is accurate either way for the styling (SGR) case — the reason to prefer
`style` is that structured attributes stay *restylable*, which raw escapes are
not. A renderable whose
**text** is empty contributes nothing — a plain `""` or `style("", fg: yellow)`
alike, since emptiness is judged by the payload text (not emitted as bare control
codes). `style` is the one styling primitive in the MVP (color + bold).

A styled value is **not a new scalar type** — it is a **string carrying display
attributes**. Everywhere *except* prompt rendering it behaves exactly as its
text: the same [argv](#spread--flattening) rule (its text crosses, an
embedded NUL is the same hard error), the same [`+=`](#arrays-lists) (it
concatenates as its text, yielding a plain string — attributes are
rendering-only and don't survive), the same comparisons and string
interpolation. **Only the prompt renderer reads the attributes**; every other
context sees a string. So `style` adds presentation metadata to a string without
minting a type that must be defined at each boundary. *(A richer per-fragment
"styled spans" value — where concatenation preserves each fragment's own style —
is a possible later iteration; the MVP keeps one attribute set per string.)*

**Line structure is the map — newlines are not in-band.** Because each top-level
entry is a line, line breaks come from the **map's shape**, never from an in-band
`\n` a callable printed, and **never from a list** — a list is the space-joined
*pieces of one line*, so **multiple lines are multiple entries** (a list element
that is itself a list is an error — no guessed flatten, no lines-from-nesting).
That is what makes the per-line features well-defined: a "line" is a map entry,
stable and addressable, not a function of what a callable happened to print. A
segment renders its **return value**, consistent with the
[value-vs-stream split](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas) — you *return* your
prompt, you don't `puts` it. (The one exception is raw external output, below,
whose `\n`s are honored — you can't dictate an external tool's line count.)

**Empty entries take no line.** An entry — or a grouped inline segment — that
renders `""` contributes **no line**, so the common "nothing to show" case (an
empty `vcs` / `jobs` / auth) simply collapses: no blank gap, and no separator to
suppress. A *deliberate* blank line is an explicit **`newline`** entry (named, e.g.
`gap`), so blank lines are opt-in, never an accident of an empty segment.

**External output is the one place `\n` is honored.** A value that *is* the raw
output of an external capture — `"$(vcs prompt-info)"` returned **directly** — may
carry `\n`, since you can't dictate an external tool's output; the shell honors
those as **dumb** breaks that the structural entries (`fill` / `rule`) don't align
across. Provenance rides the **value**, not the map slot: passing that output
through `style(…)` or string concatenation re-imports it as an ordinary mesh string
(back under the single-line rule), so a genuinely multi-line external renderer must
be returned raw, not wrapped. So a drop-in external renderer (starship, `vcs
prompt-info`) still works. The renderer measures width **per line**, tracks how many
lines the prompt occupies, and places input after the last one so redraw,
completion, and resize stay correct; there is **no line-count knob**.

**`fill` — right-align and trailing bars.** Within a line's list, **`fill`** is an
inline piece that **expands to consume the remaining width of its line**, pushing
whatever follows it to the right edge — the right-alignment primitive.
`[left fill right]` puts `left` flush-left and `right` flush-right; **multiple
`fill`s on a line split the slack evenly** (even columns). It fills with **spaces**
by default; give it a character to repeat that instead — `fill("─")` draws a bar to
the edge, so `[host-info dir-info fill("─")]` renders `host dir───────────────` out
to the right margin. **`rule` is the whole-line case of `fill`** — a line whose only
piece is `fill("─")` — so the two are one mechanism: `fill` fills the *rest of a
line*, `rule` fills a *whole line*. `fill` measures against the same per-line width
the renderer already tracks, and its own width is the slack (zero when the line is
already full).

The payoff is the requirement, met directly: **the external base renderer is
just one named segment** (`$(vcs prompt-info)`), sitting among peers, so
`[root]`, the auth warning, and the session nag compose *around* it rather than
being swallowed by it — the failure mode of "set `$PROMPT` to one big external
command." This is exactly the hand-rolled `preprompt` / `prompt_line` /
`host_info` / `auth_info` structure of today's config, promoted to first-class,
keyed, re-source-safe segments — with its *side effects* (a background fetch)
moving to the `$sh.preprompt` event hook and its *rendering* to this segment map.

*(MVP: keyed **line entries**, `style` color, an entry yielding a renderable **or a
space-joined flat list of pieces** (empties dropped, `puts`-style; each keeps its
own style), an optional keyed **sub-map** so the pieces are individually named, a
deliberate-blank **`newline`** entry, the full-width **`rule`** entry, and the
inline **`fill`** piece (right-align / trailing bar — consumes a line's slack,
multiple `fill`s split it evenly, an optional repeat-char draws a bar; `rule` ≡ a
whole-line `[fill("─")]`). Line structure is the **map** — a list is one line's
pieces, multiple lines are multiple entries — never in-band `\n` (raw external
output excepted, above). The one thing layered *past* the MVP is **transient
collapse** of past prompts in scrollback. The event set — `preprompt`,
`preexec`/`postexec`, `precd`/`postcd`, `exit` — is settled.)*

## Footguns we avoid

mesh's surface is partly *reactive*: many decisions exist to remove a specific,
well-known way an existing shell surprises people. This section collects the ones
that most shaped the design, grouped by the shell they're most associated with,
each paired with the mesh decision that defuses it. Several are drawn from real
workarounds in the author's own `bash` / `fish` / `nushell` configs — where a
comment in those files documents a hack, that hack marks the footgun.

Most of these defenses are **settled** decisions elsewhere in this document. A few
rely on mechanisms still being designed; those are marked ***(planned)*** and link
to the open TODO, so this section reads as "things we avoid" and "things we *intend*
to avoid" rather than promising the latter as done.

### bash / POSIX

- **A pipeline's `while read` silently loses its variables.**
  `n=0; seq 3 | while read x; do n=$((n+1)); done; echo "$n"` prints `0` in bash —
  the loop ran in a forked subshell, so `n` never escaped. mesh's **settled** answer is to not pipe into a loop at all: a
  [command substitution](#command-substitution) is a real list you iterate *in the
  current scope* — `for line in $(cmd) { n += 1 }` leaves `n` set, no subshell
  involved. ***(planned)*** for the literal `cmd | while gets line { … }` form to
  persist too, the **last stage of a `|` pipeline** would run in the current shell
  rather than a forked subshell — bash's opt-in `lastpipe`, intended as mesh's
  unconditional default; not yet written into [Redirection](#redirection).
- **Unquoted `$var` word-splits and globs.** `rm $file` breaks on a space; `[ $x =
  y ]` becomes a parse error when `$x` is empty. The single most common bash bug.
  mesh has **no word splitting and no implicit globbing of a value** — `$x` is
  exactly one value; splitting is opt-in (`:words` / `:split`) and exploding a list
  into arguments is the explicit `...`. See [Spread](#spread--flattening).
- **`!` in double quotes fires history expansion.** Interactive bash expands `!`
  inside double quotes — `echo "hello!world"` fails with `!world: event not found`
  (a trailing `!` before a space or end-of-line is safe, but `!` before a word is
  not, which is the trap). mesh's [history expansion](#history-expansion) is
  **quote-safe and lexically narrow**: `!` is a designator only directly before a
  ref character *and never inside quotes*, and `!=` / `!~` are excluded — so
  `"hello!world"` is plain text.
- **`[ ]` / `[[ ]]` operator quirks** — `-a`/`-o` precedence, empty-operand parse
  errors, `-lt` vs `<`, `=` vs `==`. mesh has no `[ ]`: value
  [tests](#tests-and-comparisons) are type-directed (`==` / `<`), `~` matches
  patterns, and `:exists` / `:exec` are the file tests.

### zsh

- **Over-complexity.** zsh's power is a very large, mutable surface: dozens of
  `setopt`s that silently change core semantics (whether `$x` splits, how globs
  behave, prompt parsing), plus a completion system that is its own programming
  language. mesh keeps a **small, non-optional core** — no option flips whether a
  value splits — and derives [completion](#completion) mechanically from `--help` /
  man pages rather than a bespoke DSL. Behavior you can read off the page.
- **Job-control edge cases.** zsh has a long tail of job-control surprises. mesh
  makes [jobs first-class values](#job-control) with a specified lifecycle and
  defined [signal](#signals) semantics (SIGHUP-then-SIGCONT-to-stopped on terminal
  close, Ctrl-Z ignored at an idle prompt, status snapshotted across handlers) —
  behavior that is *specified*, not emergent. The author's configs hand-roll
  `%1`…`%9` job aliases (`for i in (seq 0 9) { alias %$i = fg %$i }`); mesh's `%n`
  job refs are built in.
- **1-based indexing.** zsh (and fish) index from 1. mesh is
  [zero-based](#arrays-lists), always — matching bash/Python/Rust — so a ported
  `$xs[1]` doesn't silently shift by one.

### fish

- **Splitting and the empty-vs-scalar trap.** fish splits every command
  substitution into a list and has changed those rules over time; the standard
  defense is `| string collect`, which appears dozens of times in the author's
  `config.fish` purely to keep a result (e.g. an empty `projectroot`) a *string*
  rather than an empty list that breaks the next comparison. mesh makes splitting
  **explicit and stable**, and makes the **list-vs-scalar choice part of the
  capture** rather than a post-hoc rescue: `$(cmd)` is a list (default newline
  split, opt-in `:words` / `:nulls` / `:tabs` / `:split`, a defined
  [trailing-empty-field rule](#modifiers)), and `$(cmd):raw` is one string. You ask
  for the shape you want up front, so a value is never auto-split against your
  intent and then un-split with `string collect`. The empty cases are each clean
  and stated ([Modifiers](#modifiers)): an empty list capture is `[]`, and an empty
  `:raw` (scalar) capture is `""` — [no null](#variables-and-assignment) either
  way, so neither needs a guard.
- **Non-POSIX breaks muscle memory.** fish dropped `$(...)`, `&&` / `||` (for
  years), `export`, and more, so familiar reflexes stop working. mesh keeps the
  POSIX **spine** — `$()`, `&&` / `||`, `~`, redirection — so those reflexes
  transfer; the ergonomics are additive, not a dialect you relearn. This is about
  *syntax familiarity only*: running existing sh/bash **code** stays a
  [non-goal](#non-goals), so `source` reads mesh grammar, not POSIX. A `brew
  shellenv`-style integration (whose output is POSIX shell) therefore needs a
  mesh-native path or an adapter here just as it does in nushell (whose `config.nu`
  reimplements it by hand) — mesh's win is that the *language* stays familiar, not
  that foreign snippets run.
- **`switch` / `case` is glob-only.** fish's `case` has no regex — the author's
  config notes "fish wildcards have no `[0-9]` character class" and falls back to
  `string match -rq '^-[0-9]+$'`. mesh's [`match`](#matching-match) takes `/re/`
  arms directly.
- **`eval` for dynamic definition and indirect variables.** fish resorts to
  `eval "function $alias; ssh_to $alias \$argv; end"` to synthesize per-host
  functions, and `eval "printf ... \$$arg"` for indirect variable access. mesh's
  direction is to make both first-class rather than string-`eval`, but ***(planned)***
  — neither is settled: dynamic definition is the wrapper/forwarding TODO in
  [Functions](#functions), and by-name variable access is its own open question in
  [Variables](#variables-and-assignment) (the intended answer is a
  [map](#maps-associative-arrays) indexed by the computed name, `$colors[$name]`,
  rather than reaching into the variable namespace — but that reframe isn't yet a
  settled feature).

### elvish / nushell (rich-value shells)

- **Everything is an exception.** Elvish raises on every nonzero command (you reach
  for `?(...)` to tolerate failure), which is heavy for interactive use. mesh keeps
  the Unix **status model** — a nonzero status is a [value, not a thrown
  exception](#functions) — so `grep x f; echo done` just runs, while you can still
  branch on the status.
- **Static (parse-time) command resolution.** nushell resolves `def`→`def` calls
  at parse time, so you *cannot* redefine a command and have existing callers pick
  it up (the author's `config.nu` documents this and routes overridable hooks
  through `$env.*` closures invoked with `do`). mesh resolves function calls at
  **call time** (see [Isolation](#isolation-and-subshells)), so a later
  redefinition or a hook override is visible to callers — no closure-in-a-variable
  workaround.
- **No exit hook.** nushell has none, so the author's job-publish file can't be
  cleaned up on shell exit. mesh's `exit` hook — with the full `preprompt` /
  `preexec` / `postexec` / `precd` / `postcd` set — is part of the core
  ([Hooks](#hooks-and-the-prompt)).
- **Rich-value ↔ byte-stream friction.** Elvish/nushell's structured values don't
  flow cleanly into byte-oriented Unix tools; you convert at every boundary. mesh
  draws the [bytes-vs-values line explicitly](#command-substitution) at the
  external-command edge (argv rendering rules; `puts` renders, externals take
  `...` / `:join`), so you always know which side you're on — rich values inside,
  bytes at the process boundary.
- **Unfamiliar syntax tax.** Elvish's `{|a b| … }` lambdas and data literals are a
  real relearn. mesh puts signatures where readers already look
  (`func name(params)`), keeps `$var`, and borrows the *semantics* (rest / flag /
  default params) not the syntax — see [Functions](#functions).

## Open questions

- **Name — decided: mesh** ([Name](#name)); smash was the runner-up.
- **Exclusion `~` alias** — resolved by elimination: `~` / `!~` is now the
  **pattern-match** operator ([Tests and comparisons](#tests-and-comparisons)),
  so glob exclusion keeps the spaced infix `-` only.
- **String modifier set** — `:replaceall` (global substitution) with decided but
  lower-priority anchored/removal kin (`:replacestart` / `:replaceend` /
  `:stripstart` / `:stripend`, plus `:trimstart` / `:trimend` for whitespace).
  Substitution is settled: a **regex `OLD` in `:replaceall`** (`:replaceall(/foo/, bar)`),
  **not** a `:s/old/new/` form (`:s` is the `:dotall` flag; arguments stay
  parenthesized) — see [Modifiers](#modifiers). Remaining: backref spelling and
  whether a first-only `:replace` is ever needed.
- **Member access inside string interpolation — decided:** `$map.field` has the
  same meaning inside and outside `"…"`. Use `${file}.bak` when a dot begins a
  literal suffix rather than member access ([Variables and assignment](#variables-and-assignment)).
- **Predicate qualifier syntax** — confirm `size >` / `age <` / `mtime <` forms.
- **History expansion — decided** ([History expansion](#history-expansion)):
  interactive-only, quote-safe `!!` / `!string` / `!$` (with `!*` / `!n` deferred);
  the `!` clash resolved lexically (a designator must follow, so `!=` / `!~` and a
  lone `!` are untouched); both quotes make `!` literal, `\!` escapes, and
  `$sh.options.histexpand = off` disables it. Substitution is a chainable,
  **global** **`:old=new`** modifier on any history reference (`!git:foo=bar:x=y`;
  quote each side or backslash-escape for spaces / specials), with **`^old^new`**
  as shorthand for `!!:old=new`.
- **Interactive history (store & recall) — decided**
  ([Interactive history](#interactive-history)): a **SQLite** store at
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mesh/history.sqlite3` with rich per-entry columns
  (command / cwd / tty / session / start / duration / status) populated by
  `preexec` / `postexec`; recall via up/down and `Ctrl-R`; a `history` built-in
  plus `history | grep` as the MVP search. Remaining: fuzzy search, a
  `$sh.history` accessor, cross-session sync, dedup policy, and secret redaction.
- **Interactive signals — decided** ([Signals](#signals)): interactive defaults
  (`Ctrl-C` abandons the line / interrupts the foreground job but never kills the
  shell; `Ctrl-D` EOFs on an empty line; `Ctrl-Z` suspends; `SIGWINCH` redraws;
  `SIGHUP` exits, `SIGTERM` ignored). User handlers are the keyed **`$sh.signal.<NAME>`**
  hook maps (no bash `trap`), with `$sh.exit` as the EXIT trap. Remaining: whether
  a handler may suppress a default, and mid-pipeline SIGINT delivery.
- **Core surface** (arrays / maps / functions / `if` / `match` / loops / scope /
  tests / isolation) — sketched above. Remaining sub-questions: an infix **`in`**
  operator as a second membership spelling alongside `:has`; whether non-`_` `match`
  must be **exhaustive** (leaning lenient → `""`); and the `match` **spelling**
  itself — keyword-vs-`case`, and infix `$x match` vs prefix `match $x`
  (see [Matching](#matching-match)). *(Decided this pass: a `/re/` `match` arm does
  **not** auto-bind its captures — capture goes through the value-side `:match`
  extractor, see [Matching](#matching-match) and [Destructuring](#destructuring).)*
  M3 **ships a multi-way pattern construct** in place of `case`
  (literal/glob/`/regex/`/range/`_` arms; no single-arm sugar — `~` covers the one-test
  case only for the **string glob/regex** subset it shares with an arm, not literal,
  range, or list-binding tests, see [Matching](#matching-match)), currently spelled
  `match $x { … }`; its *spelling* (keyword and prefix-vs-infix) is the open
  sub-question above, not a settled choice. **Tests**
  replace `[[ ]]` (`~`/`!~` pattern-match, type-directed
  comparisons, `$p:type`/`:exists`/`:exec` file tests, `and`/`or`/`not` vs command
  `&&`/`||`); the **postfix guard** `stmt if/unless cond` is the one-line form;
  **isolation** is explicit — plain `func` persists cwd/state, `fork { }` /
  `fork func f() { }` subshell-isolate, `in DIR { }` scopes cwd without forking.
- **Value calls & lambdas — decided** ([section](#calling-for-a-value-and-lambdas)):
  `f(arg)` (parens attached, comma-separated args) takes a function's **return
  value**, `$(f arg)` its **stdout**, bare `f arg` runs it; stdout streams during
  a value call (independent channels); externals have no return value (runtime
  error → `$(…)`). Lambdas are `func(params) { … }` (anonymous, one param
  grammar), passed to `:map` / `:filter` / `:each`.
- **Remaining function questions** — whether a **`func` defined inside a `func`**
  is visible only there; and a **TODO — dynamic scope**: the "extract a chunk
  into a subfunction" goal that fixed cwd as *persist* would be served further by
  letting an extracted helper see the caller's locals — weigh dynamic (or opt-in
  dynamic) scope against the lexical default.
- **Hook API — decided** ([Hooks and the prompt](#hooks-and-the-prompt)): hook
  points are insertion-ordered maps of named callables (the key is the handler's
  identity → re-source-safe, individually removable). Events `preprompt`,
  `preexec`/`postexec`, `precd`/`postcd`, `exit`; the prompt is a named, ordered
  segment map with the external renderer as one peer segment. Prompt MVP: **each
  top-level entry is a line** (implicit breaks between entries — no separator keys),
  an entry yields a renderable **or a space-joined flat list of pieces**
  (`puts`-style, empties dropped, each keeping its own style), with a keyed
  **sub-map** variant to name the pieces; `style` color; a deliberate-blank
  **`newline`** entry; the full-width **`rule`** entry; and the inline **`fill`**
  piece (right-align / trailing bar, multiple `fill`s split slack evenly, optional
  repeat-char; `rule` ≡ a whole-line `[fill("─")]`). A list is one line's pieces —
  **multiple lines are multiple entries** — and line structure is the map, not
  in-band `\n` (raw external output excepted, as dumb breaks). A bare word in a
  segment slot is the callable of that name (late-bound); quote for a literal.
  Remaining: transient collapse.
- **Structured prompt — direction decided** ([Hooks and the prompt](#hooks-and-the-prompt)):
  line structure is the **map**, not in-band newlines — **each top-level entry is a
  line** (implicit breaks; no `nl1`/`nl2` separator keys), a line's pieces are a
  **space-joined flat list** (or a keyed **sub-map** to name them), a deliberate
  blank line is a named **`newline`** entry, and **`fill`** is the inline
  right-align / trailing-bar piece (`rule` ≡ a whole-line `[fill("─")]`). A list is
  one line's pieces, so **multiple lines are multiple entries** — the keyed-map
  shape won over a whole-prompt list-of-lines (which would have made rows positional,
  not keyed). `rule`, `fill`, and `newline` are all in the MVP. **Remaining:**
  **transient collapse** of past prompts, now that lines are explicit and
  addressable.

**Foundational specification work.** The entries above settle *surface* features;
these five are the deeper contracts an implementation needs before code. They
are called out together because tooling, error recovery, and the Rust data
representation all depend on them; contracts still marked as needing a decision
remain under-specified.

- **Grammar and precedence — decided.** [`PARSER.md`](PARSER.md) is the parser
  contract: it covers adjacency/concatenation, modifier arguments, value calls,
  ranges, redirects, backgrounding, pipelines, conditional chains, postfix
  guards, and termination. In particular, `a | b && c &` backgrounds the whole
  `&&` list, while a redirect attaches to the nearest simple command. Keeping the
  executable subset in [`GRAMMAR.md`](GRAMMAR.md) separate lets implementation
  progress be recorded without reopening the target grammar.
- **Status lifetime.** Define exactly when `$sh.status` changes. Provisional: a
  pipeline's status is its **last stage**, every stage retained in
  [`$sh.pipestatus`](#variables-and-assignment); decide whether a **`pipefail`**
  option is in the MVP (leaning: available, default off). Specify the status after
  a plain assignment, a value expression, a parse error vs a runtime error, a
  background launch (`&`), and hook dispatch (already snapshotted/restored around
  hooks). mesh adds **no implicit `errexit`**; interactive and `source`d
  configuration errors therefore need an explicit recovery rule (see failure
  classes below) rather than unpredictable termination.
- **Condition truthiness — needs a table or a narrowing.** Ordinary `if` / `while`
  accept a bool or a command status; the [assignment-condition](#conditionals-if-is-an-expression)
  additionally calls the RHS "truthy," which needs a per-type table or should be
  narrowed. Leaning: **narrow it to the status view** — bool `false`, a failed
  command, and a nonzero `int` are false; everything else (including `""`, `[]`,
  `[:]`, and any non-empty value) is true — so truthiness is never
  content-emptiness, and pattern-fit stays the separate gate. That keeps it
  consistent with the result/status model and `gets`'s truthy `""`, and avoids
  inventing collection-truthiness. Write the table out explicitly for every value
  type.
- **Text vs bytes — the encoding model.** Decide whether a mesh string is an
  arbitrary **byte string** or guaranteed **UTF-8**; how undecodable filenames and
  command output are represented (leaning: bytes that round-trip losslessly, so a
  non-UTF-8 path survives capture → argv unharmed); what a **"character" index**
  means (byte / scalar value / grapheme); and which operations require text
  (case-fold, display width, parsing) versus bytes (pipes, captures, argv, paths).
  Leaning: a string is a **byte string that is usually UTF-8** — byte operations
  never decode, text operations decode on demand and **fail loud** on an invalid
  sequence. This must precede the Rust representation and is essential on Unix,
  where paths are not guaranteed UTF-8.
- **Failure classes — mostly settled** ([Error handling](#error-handling)). The
  execution model is now written up: **two channels** (value-level failure vs
  fail-loud errors), **strict-by-default / soft-by-opt-in** with a strict/soft table,
  the reconciliation that a no-`else` `if` is a *soft* form (so it is consistent
  with fail-loud), and the **boundary-catch** recovery rule (interactive line,
  `source`, prompt/hook/completion, script). **Remaining open:** whether to expose a
  **user-facing** `try` / `catch` or `?(…)` capture for channel-2 errors with no
  soft twin, or ship only the boundary-catch + soft twins for the MVP (leaning: no
  user catch in the MVP).

## Name

**mesh.** No other shell claims the name — the cleanest option on that axis. Two
tradeoffs accepted: the word is heavily overloaded in infra (service mesh, mesh
networking, WiFi mesh), and it sits one letter from `mosh` (mobile shell), an
adjacent tool, so there is a real read-alike / typo risk.

Runner-up: **smash** — distinctive and unconfusable, but with soft collisions
(abandoned toy shells; HPE's unrelated SMASH server-management standard).
Rejected along the way: `lish`, `lsh`, `sish`, `ish`, `bish`, `sash` (all taken
by real or well-known tools).
